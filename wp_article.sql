This will be the first WordCamp in Canada East of Montreal, making it <em>the</em> web-related event of the season for Maritimers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Get To Know Halifax</h2>\n<p>Halifax is best known for its friendly community and beautiful harbour. Take in cafes, beer gardens, the Citadel Hill, a farmers market and more pubs than you can count! May is a lovely time of year on the peninsula with lots of sunshine and occasional shower. Be sure to check out the newly built Central Library downtown &#8211; a spectacular architectural feat. Spend the whole week in Halifax to take road trips to other beautiful parts of the province: wine tours, U-picks and quaint fishing villages can all be found within a few hours drive away from the capital.</p>\n<p>WordCamp has affordable accommodations if you want to stay close to the venue. More information can be <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/venue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found here</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What To Expect At WordCamp Halifax</h2>\n<p>With a mere $25 price tag, attendees can expect to enjoy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catered lunch</li>\n<li>Swag bag with lots of goodies</li>\n<li>Happiness Bar where attendees can get one-on-one help with their website</li>\n<li>Lots of networking with people from a multitude of industries and skill levels</li>\n<li>25 local, national and international <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/speakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speakers</a></li>\n<li>21 <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/sessions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">informative sessions</a> in three tracks</li>\n<li>An After Party five minutes from the venue, with affordable bevvy&#8217;s &amp; snacks (you know how Haligonians love a good kitchen party!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team has worked hard to bring diverse programming to this inaugural WordCamp with three tracks of learning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content Creators:</strong> Easiest sessions.

Filed under <a title=\"View all posts in Releases\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\" rel=\"category tag\">Releases</a>.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>Version 3.7 of WordPress, named “Basie” in honor of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_basie\">Count Basie</a>, is available <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">for download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. This release features some of the most important architectural updates we’ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don’t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site’s first line of defense. It’s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements.

WordPress 4.9.5, scheduled for release in April, will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\">feature a call-out prompt</a> that has links to information about Gutenberg and a button to quickly install the plugin if user permissions allow. <br /></p>\n\n<img />\n    Gutenberg Call-out in WordPress 4.9.5\n\n\n<p>The core team added a Try Gutenberg prompt in October of last year but <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-beta-4-removes-try-gutenberg-call-to-action\">it was removed</a> in WordPress 4.9 Beta 4. After discussing the subject with Mullenweg, it was determined that Gutenberg was not ready for large-scale testing.</p>\n\n<p>The prompt in WordPress 4.9.5 changes the button text based on the following scenarios.<br /></p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is not installed, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Install Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed but not activated, <em>and</em> the user can install plugins, the Activate Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n    <li>If Gutenberg is installed and activated, <em>and</em> the user can edit posts, the Try Today button is displayed.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg is not installed and the user can not install plugins, the button is hidden from view. If you&#x27;d like to hide the prompt from users, David Decker has <a href=\"https://github.com/deckerweb/remove-gutenberg-panel\">created a plugin</a> that&#x27;s available on GitHub that simply hides it from view.</p>\n\n<p>One of the concerns about the prompt is the lack of warning of the risks involved using beta software on a live site. Gutenberg is beta software that&#x27;s still in development that could <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:75\">adversely affect sites</a>. There is no warning on the call-out box and in two clicks, users can install and activate Gutenberg. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Whether it&#x27;s Gutenberg or some other beta software, this general advice applies. Create a full backup of your site before installing and if possible, install it on a staging site first.</p>\n\n<p>I predict that the volunteers who manage the WordPress.org support forums will have their hands full once WordPress 4.9.5 is released. The support team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/2018/03/agenda-for-march-22nd-support-meeting/\">is preparing</a> by brainstorming user outcomes, common questions that may be asked, and potential pitfalls users experience after installing Gutenberg. <br /></p>\n\n<p>If you&#x27;d like to give them a helping hand, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/\">Support Handbook</a> and if you have any questions, stop by the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fforums%2F\">#forums</a> channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg call-out has the potential to pave the way for large audiences to test major features in core without needing to use or install a beta branch of WordPress. However, this convenience comes with risks and while they can be reduced, WordPress needs to be up front and center to users about those risks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 22:55:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WPTavern: Why Gutenberg and Why Now?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://wptavern.com/why-gutenberg-and-why-now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17921:\"<img />\n\n<p>Tevya Washburn has been building websites for more than 20 years and building them on WordPress for 10. He bootstrapped his website maintenance and support company, <a href=\"http://wordx.press\">WordXpress</a>, that he’s worked on full-time for more than seven years.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year he launched his first premium plugin, and presented at WordCamp Salt Lake City. He lives in Caldwell, ID and is the founding member of the WordPress Meetup group in Western Idaho. <br /></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It was only a few months ago that I knew almost nothing about WordPress’ new Gutenberg editor. I had a basic concept of what it was and this vague annoyance that it would mean I’d have to learn new things and probably put a lot of effort into making some sites or projects work with it.</p>\n\n<p>I kept hearing all of the frustration and issues with Gutenberg itself and the lack of information on how to integrate with it. At <a href=\"https://wordx.press\">WordX</a>p<a href=\"https://wordx.press\">ress</a> we recently pivoted away from designing websites. When we designed them in the past, we used premium themes. I figured Gutenberg was the theme developer’s problem.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I still had this feeling of dread though, knowing many of my favorite plugins might not add support for it. I also felt some apprehension that even if the themes we use did add support for it, they might have a lot of new bugs through the first few releases.</p>\n\n<p>Then I launched my first WordPress plugin, <a href=\"https://starfishwp.com\">Starfish Reviews</a>, and suddenly they weren’t someone else’s problems anymore! Now I’d have to come up with a plan to integrate our plugin with Gutenberg. I installed the Gutenberg plugin on a test site where we were testing our plugin with the nightly releases of WordPress and started playing around with it.</p>\n\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive and easy it was to use! Now it wasn’t (and isn’t) finished, so there were bugs and annoyances, but overall I was impressed.</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, I suggested we should have someone present on Gutenberg at our local meetup. My brief experience was more than what anyone else had, so the responsibility fell on me. Preparing for the presentation forced me to look at Gutenberg more carefully and pay more attention to the information and debate going on throughout the community.</p>\n\n<p>I started reading blog posts, paying more attention in podcasts, and even looking at what was being said on Twitter. I watched the State of the Word at WordCamp US where the general tide in the feelings toward Gutenberg, seemed to turn, though many people still remain skeptical, critical, or antagonistic toward the project as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I saw someone suggesting legal action if Gutenberg caused problems on their sites. That’s ridiculous on several levels, but shows that there’s still a lot of suspicion, frustration, and outright anger around Gutenberg.</p>\n\n<p><em>A couple notes: 1. the graphs below are for illustration purposes only, they’re not meant to be accurate to any actual data. 2. If you prefer listening, you can </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ZqrVJ465E\"><em>watch my screencast version</em></a><em> (13:12) of what follows. The message is the same, but differs in many aspects of presentation.</em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Finding the Why</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Simon Sinek is known for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA\">his Ted talk</a> where he explains that most people explain a new product or service by talking about ‘what’ it is and ‘how’ it works, but they rarely explain the ‘why’ behind it. The ‘why’ actually resonates with people the most. They want to understand the reason and beliefs behind it.</p>\n\n<p>In my research, I couldn’t seem to find a clear answer to the most important question: “Why Gutenberg?” If I was going to present to people who knew little or nothing about it, I wanted to provide a reason why this major change was coming that might cause significant frustration, work, and pain for them.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I found a lot of ‘what’ and ‘how’ about Gutenberg. In some posts by <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/post/gutenberg-or-the-ship-of-theseus/\">Matías Ventura</a>, I found hints about ‘why’ Gutenberg existed, but no really clear, simple explanation of why this whole project was happening. Why would Matt and others want to seemingly force this major change on us all? Why does it have to be such a radical departure from the past? Why now?</p>\n\n<p>I was certain the conspiracy theorists—who seem to believe that Automattic’s sole mission is to make their lives more miserable—were wrong. But what was the purpose? Could it really just be a <strong>me too</strong> attitude that left all of these brilliant minds feeling like they had to keep up with Squarespace and Medium? That didn’t seem to fit. Especially since Gutenberg is already leagues better than Squarespace’s convoluted visual editor.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Innovative Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<img />\n    The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma Book Cover\n\n\n<p>Taking cues from those hints and suggestions, I started thinking about the innovative disruption model. It was popularized in business circles, starting in 1997 when the book “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma\">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>” was published by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard professor. His book was an expansion of an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave\">earlier article</a> in the Harvard Business Review.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of oversimplifying the model, innovative disruption is what happens when an existing company who is the top dog (either in sales or market share) gets comfortable with their position at the top along with their revenue stream and quits innovating. They make small, incremental updates to their products or services to keep customers happy, but fail to look at the future of their industry.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it easier for a startup or smaller, more innovative company to bring a new product or service to market that completely disrupts the existing market because it’s better, faster, cheaper. The established company doesn’t see the disruption coming because they feel secure in their large market share and steady sales revenue. They often respond with “why would anyone want that?” when approached with the new model that is about to completely upset their business model.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Blockbuster Gets Busted</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The classic example of this is Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc. They had over 9,000 stores at one time, allowing people to rent VHS tapes and later, DVDs. They had a huge portion of the market all to themselves and it seemed nobody could compete with this juggernaut.</p>\n\n<p>Then along came two small startups: Netflix and Redbox. Netflix comes along and says “we’re going to stream movies over the internet. That’s the future and the way everyone will want to consume movies and TV in the future. But since the internet is too slow right now, we’ll just start by mailing DVDs to people.”</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster looked at this and said, “the internet is <em>way</em> too slow to stream movies. That’s ridiculous! Who wants to wait two weeks to get a movie in the mail?! Hahaha! Stupid startup, they’re wasting their money and energy.” In hindsight this seems ridiculous. At the time, most people would have agreed with Blockbuster.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, people started changing the way they rented movies. Once they tried it, they were happy to pay a subscription and use a queue to get DVDs delivered in the mail. Ultimately, making the decision of what to watch ahead of time was better than wandering through a cathedral of DVDs only to find the one you wanted to watch has already been checked out.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer internet bandwidth speeds quickly caught up. Netflix even invented some of the technologies that provide high quality streaming video to your home. Now, most of us can’t imagine having to go to the store to rent a physical copy of a movie. And those that can, get them from a Redbox kiosk that has a limited selection, but is much quicker and easier than a video store. Netflix now has a larger market share than Blockbuster ever did, with <em>zero</em> physical locations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>There are exactly nine Blockbuster stores still operating, mostly in Alaska. From 9,000 down to nine in only a few years! This is what failing to innovate does. This is how comfort and confidence in market share and sales blinds people and organizations to the coming innovations that will disrupt their market.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Literacy, Disruption, and Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Disruptive innovation doesn’t apply just in business. I have a Bachelor’s degree in history. So one example I love to use is how literacy and education ultimately toppled monarchies and traditional power structures in favor of republics and representative democracy.</p>\n\n<p>The choice of Gutenberg as the name of the new WordPress editor seems prescient in this example as well. The name was one of the clues that led me to answer the ‘why?’ question. It was Johannes Gutenberg and his movable type printing press that was the innovative disruption that changed everything!</p>\n\n<p>Before that, the vast majority of people in Europe were illiterate and uneducated. The scarcity of books and written material made it impractical and prohibitively expensive for most people to learn to read. It also allowed the Church and aristocracy to control the opportunity to become literate. That meant the rich and powerful were the gatekeepers of knowledge. Most riots and uprisings to this point were about hunger.</p>\n\n<p>The Gutenberg press changed all that. Suddenly books could be mass-produced faster, cheaper, better than they ever could before. Literacy caught on like a wildfire. The power structures thought they could control it and maintain the status quo. They outlawed printing without state approval and did many other things to limit the spread of ideas through printed materials.</p>\n\n<p>But it was too late, the power to spread ideas that the printing press provided was much too viral. Many printing presses were operated illegally, then destroyed when they were discovered by authorities.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>The tipping point had been reached though. The ability to read and spread ideas via printed documents was much more powerful than the money, soldiers, and weapons of the monarchy. Though hunger might have sparked riots and uprisings from this time on, those tiny flames were fanned into an inferno of revolution by ideas spread through printed words. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine\">Thomas Paine</a>’s Common Sense is a great example if you want to learn more about concrete examples.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Pain of Disrupting Yourself</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I don’t have a business degree, but from my understanding, <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> can be simplified down to this: to survive, and stay on top, a company (or software, or community) must innovate. It <em>can not</em> be incremental innovation. It <em>must</em> be innovation that disrupts the company’s core product or business model, even to the point of entirely replacing it.</p>\n\n<p>Blockbuster tried some Redbox-like and Netflix-like solutions, but they were too little, too late. The only way they could have survived would have been to disrupt their own business model and service. They would have had to say, “in five years we will close all 9k stores and completely shift our business to providing video online.”</p>\n\n<p>Who does that? Who thinks “we have built an empire, but we have to completely change it and replace it all over again”? That’s “The Innovator’s Dilemma” that the book’s title refers to: it’s incredibly difficult to think in those terms when you’re on the top. It’s nearly impossible to say, “we have to disrupt ourselves. We must compete with our own business and products and services.” But ultimately it’s the only way to survive.</p>\n\n<p>…Or you can buy an innovative company and let them disrupt your main business. Did you know Blockbuster had the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-ceo-passed-up-chance-to-buy-netflix-for-50-million-2015-7\">chance to buy Netflix</a> for $50 million in 2000? It was pocket change, but they passed because it was a very small, niche business.</p>\n\n<p>Had they bought Netflix and allowed it to continue innovating and disrupting their core retail rental model, Blockbuster might still be around. It wouldn’t have 9k retail stores, but it would have an even larger market share than it ever did renting DVDs.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>In either case, the process is painful. That’s why it’s called disruptive. Not because it’s a walk on the beach or small speed bump, but because it takes a lot of work and forward-thinking and causes a lot of pain to create and implement.</p>\n\n<p>If you are the market leader, you can’t rest on your previous success. You have to change everything once again, like you did to get to where you are now. Despite the pain of doing it, you have to invest yourself and your resources into hard work and difficult questions and challenging thinking that goes directly counter to our natural tendency as humans. If you want to stay on top, it’s the only way.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>WordPress is Ripe for Disruption</strong></h2>\n\n<p>WordPress has a 30% market share right now. It won’t be long before 1 out of every 3 websites is built on WordPress. No other platform is even close.</p>\n\n<p>As WordPress professionals and community members, it seems like we have all the momentum and benefits of being the leader. “Surely nothing could displace WordPress!” That’s what Blockbuster said. That’s what monarchs of past ages said. The truth is simple: “yes, something could. In fact, something will, if WordPress doesn’t innovatively disrupt itself.”</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>Is it going to be painful? Yes. Is it going to cause a lot of work and effort on the part of the community? Yes! Absolutely. But the alternative is to learn a totally new platform in five years when WordPress dies like Blockbuster did. You think this change is going to be difficult? Try throwing out WordPress entirely and moving your website(s) to an entirely new platform. Because that’s the alternative.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Good Arguments Against Gutenberg</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I see many people listing a string of bugs in the Gutenberg UI/UX and concluding that Gutenberg shouldn’t exist. I see others critiquing the underlying technologies and claiming that’s evidence that Gutenberg is entirely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry, but those arguments are entirely invalid. They may be great arguments for how Gutenberg needs to change or improve, but they are <em>not</em> valid arguments against the existence of Gutenberg and its inclusion in core.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, I’ve made it clear that WordPress is in dire need of innovation. If that’s true, then as I see it, there’s only one really great argument against Gutenberg. As one person in one of the meetups I presented at put it: “is it the right innovation?”</p>\n\n<p>That&#x27;s the crux of the whole thing: <strong>WordPress must innovate to survive</strong>. Matt Mullenweg and the entire Gutenberg team have looked at the past and the future and decided that a better, faster, easier user interface and experience, are the disruptive innovations that WordPress needs to survive.</p>\n\n<p>You can argue that it’s not, that there’s some other innovation that will completely change WordPress and thereby save it from disruption by outside forces. And that&#x27;s a totally valid argument to make. But in my opinion, <strong>you can’t argue that continued, incremental changes are enough.</strong> You can’t argue that the path we’ve been on the last five years is going to keep WordPress on top for the next five years. It simply won’t.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>I Like Gutenberg, but I Love What it’s Doing</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In my experience thus far, I like Gutenberg. I believe it is the right disruptive innovation WordPress needs at this time. It will make WordPress easier to use and help its underpinnings be ready for the future. Being easy to use is what got WordPress where it is today.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not very easy to use any more. There are significantly easier options out there, that could disrupt WordPress and replace it. I think Gutenberg will allow WordPress to disrupt itself and keep ahead of other disruptive innovations. It will save WordPress and allow us all to keep using it and building our businesses on it for another 10 years into the future.</p>\n\n<p>I like Gutenberg, but I really love what Gutenberg means, what it represents, and what it&#x27;s doing. Gutenberg is bigger than just a new post editor, it shows that the leaders of the WordPress community are willing to make hard decisions and innovate even when it means disrupting their own work and previous innovations.</p>\n\n<img />\n\n<p>I have huge respect for the Gutenberg team, who have not only had to rethink everything and do all those difficult things I referred to before, but have had to do it all very publicly, while navigating a gauntlet of criticism, personal attacks, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this post shows my thanks and newfound appreciation for what they’re doing and going through. Flipping the phrase from <em>The Dark Knight,</em> the members of the Gutenberg team are “the heroes the WordPress community needs right now, even if they’re not the ones we deserve.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:20:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Post Status: The Future of Content Distribution — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=44599\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/future-content-distribution-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2385:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

As most of you can probably imagine, BuddyPress was a different piece of software back then, trying to solve a completely different decade&#8217;s worth of problems for a completely different version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress was multisite only, meaning it did not work on the regular version of WordPress that most people were accustomed to installing. It needed to completely take over the entire website experience to work, with a specific theme for the primary part of your site, and blog themes for user profiles and everything else.</p>\n<p>There was a lot to love about the original vision and version of BuddyPress. It was ambitious, but in a clever kind of way that made everyone tilt their heads, squint their eyes, and ponder what WordPress was capable of. BuddyPress knew exactly what it was trying to do, and owned it without apologies.</p>\n<p>It touted itself as a &#8220;Social Network in a box&#8221; at a time when MySpace was generating 75.9 million <em>unique</em> visitors per month, so if you couldn&#8217;t imagine how different BuddyPress may have been before, imagine how excited everyone was at the idea of owning their own MySpace.</p>\n<p>Since then, Andy invited <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges\">Boone</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/djpaul\">Paul</a>, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby\">me</a> to help lead the project forward, and in-turn we&#8217;ve invited several other prolific BuddyPress contributors to help with every aspect of the project, website, design, and so on.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress team has grown in a few different ways. Most recently, we&#8217;ve added <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/espellcaste\">Renato Alves</a> to the team to help with WP-CLI support. Renato is a long-time contributor who stepped up big-time to really own the WP-CLI implementation and finally see it through to the end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/slaffik\">Slava Abakumov</a> lead the 2.8 release, and we finally met in person for the very first time just last week at WordCamp Miami. He&#8217;s another long-time contributor who has always had the best interests of the project in mind and at heart.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/offereins\">Laurens Offereins</a> has been helping fix BuddyPress bugs and work on evolving features since version 2.1, and while we haven&#8217;t met in person <em>yet</em>, I look forward to it someday!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/netweb\">Stephen Edgar</a> (who you may recognize from bbPress) also works a bit on BuddyPress, largely around tooling &amp; meta related things, but he&#8217;s fully capable and will jump in and help anywhere he can, be it the forums or features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mercime\">Mercime</a> would prefer I not blather on endlessly here about how important she is, or how much I appreciate her, or anything like that, so please forget I mentioned it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hnla\">Hugo Ashmore</a> has spent the past 2 years completely rebuilding the default template pack. This is an absolutely huge undertaking, and everyone is really excited about sunsetting ye olde <code>bp-legacy</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister</a> has moved on to work on the enormously important and equally ambitious <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> project. Tammie is wonderful, and doing a great job crafting what the future of democratizing publishing is.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a few of our veteran team members took sabbaticals from contributing to BuddyPress in the past few years, which I see as an opportunity to return with fresh ideas and perspectives, or maybe moving onto new &amp; exciting challenges. This is a good, healthy thing to do, both for oneself and the project. Space makes the heart grow fonder, and all that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A small aside but worth saying here &amp; now, is that leading an open-source project is everything you think it is (or maybe have read already that it is) and like a million other things that are hard to understand until you understand. The one constant (and subsequently the hardest and funnest part) is how to provide opportunities for personal growth, without prohibiting contributions, while also doing what&#8217;s best for the greater vision of the project itself, amongst a completely remote group of bespoke volunteers. I think Paul, Boone, and I do OK at this, but we are always learning and adjusting, so please reach out to us if there is anything we can do differently or better.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>BuddyPress is my personal favorite piece of software. It&#8217;s my favorite community. I wake up excited every day because of what it can do and who it does it for. Put another way, I love what we make it do and who we make it for: ourselves, one another, each other, and you.</p>\n<p>Cheers to 10 years, and here&#8217;s to another 10!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-271562 size-full\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-4.38.12-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"898\" height=\"452\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 22:54:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"JJJ\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Noteworthy Changes Coming in WordPress 4.9.5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78611\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/noteworthy-changes-coming-in-wordpress-4-9-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2401:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.5 Beta 1 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/21/wordpress-4-9-5-beta/\">is available</a> for testing and brings with it 23 bug fixes and improvements. A release candidate is scheduled for release on March 20th and a final release on April 3rd. Here are some notable changes you can expect in the release.</p>\n\n<h3>\"Cheatin’ uh?\" Error Message is Replaced</h3>\n\n<p>The \"Cheatin’ uh?\" error message has existed in WordPress for years and for some, is insulting. The error doesn&#x27;t explain what went wrong and accuses the user of trying to cheat the system.</p>\n\n<img />\n    Cheatin&#x27; Uh Error Message<br />\n\n\n<p>Eric Meyer highlighted the error in <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/06/24/eric-a-meyer-design-for-real-life/\">his keynote</a> at WordCamp North East Ohio in 2016, when talking about Designing for Real Life. He also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332#comment:11\">contributed to the ticket</a> with suggestions on how to improve the wording.</p>\n\n<p>In WordPress 4.9.5, the error <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38332\">has been changed</a> to more meaningful messages depending on the error that occurs.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended PHP Version Increased to 7.2</h3>\n\n<p>Inside of the readme file in WordPress, the current recommended PHP version is 7.0. This version of PHP reached end of life last December. In 4.9.5, the recommend version is PHP 7.2. This is the same version that is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">recommended on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Offensive Lyrics Removed From Hello Dolly</h3>\n\n<p>As we covered <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/without-context-some-lyrics-inside-the-hello-dolly-plugin-are-degrading-to-women\">earlier this week</a>, some of the lines displayed in the dashboard from the Hello Dolly plugin are inappropriate without context. In 4.9.5, the plugin will no longer display those lines.</p>\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a possibility that in the future, there will be a musical note icon or symbol placed next to the line to indicate it&#x27;s from a song. In addition, the lyrics are more in line with Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording.</p>\n\n<p>To see a full list of changes in WordPress 4.9.5, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.9.5&group=component\">view a full list</a> of closed tickets on Trac. </p>\n\n<p><br /></p><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 21:32:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 309 – All AMPed Up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=78601&preview=true&preview_id=78601\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-309-all-amped-up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2180:\"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://medinathoughts.com/\">Alberto Medina</a>, Developer Advocate working with the Web Content Ecosystems Team at Google, and <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/\">Weston Ruter</a>, CTO of XWP.

The business side isn&#8217;t nearly as loving and supportive as the community side, and some of that is out of necessity. Business is business, and people need to eat.</p>\n<p>The problem comes when people get so focused on the business side of things that they forget they&#8217;re dealing with people. Recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/971182969514799105\">Carl Hancock mentioned on twitter</a> that there are things that happen in business in the WordPress community that would horrify people.

In many of the Google search results for Hello Dolly lyrics by Jerry Herman, shows that the lyrics inside the plugin and those in the song are different.</p>\n\n<p>The lyrics say, \"Find me a vacant knee, fellas.\" In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RETJfq1U_gg\">video on YouTube</a> of Hello Dolly featuring Sarah Gardner singing the lyrics, she clearly says \"Find her an empty lap, fellas.\" In a YouTube video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfeKUNDDYs\">Louis Armstrong singing Hello Dolly live</a>, he says \"Find her an empty lap, fellas.\"<br /></p>\n\n<p>Putting aside the debate of which version of the lyrics are used, displaying the text above without context can and is seen as degrading women. At a time when WordPress and its community are doing what it can to be more inclusive, changing or removing the lyrics seems like an easy win. </p>\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 20:45:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Watch WordCamp Miami 2018 Via Free Livestream\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78359\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-wordcamp-miami-2018-via-free-livestream\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:618:\"<p>Tickets for the event may be sold out, but you can watch the event from anywhere thanks to a <a href=\"https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/live/\">free livestream</a>.

Also of note is that <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-contributing-to-open-source\">less than half</a> of the respondents say they contribute to open source.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of interesting data points in the survey.

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss the power of network effects and how they relate to WordPress’ increasing market share and maturity. WordPress has recently hit two major milestones, turning 15 years old and reaching 30% market share of the top 10 million websites, and we spend this episode reflecting on the innovations that brought us here and where innovations are likely to occur over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We’ve come quite a long way in these 15 years. From the famous 5-minute install to being entirely pre-installed. From a supportive band of volunteers and vast ecosystem of free software to the commercially supported and highly-polished products that exist today. There is a lot about WordPress to be thankful for, and a lot of great things that will exist in the future because of it. And you can hear a bit about all of that on this episode of the Post Status Draft podcast.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8\">The Power of Network Effects</a></li>\n<li>Mel Choice&#8217;s LoopConf presentation on <a href=\"https://loopconf.com/talk/customizing-the-future/\">Customizing the Future</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: Yoast</h3>\n<p>Yoast SEO Premium gives you 24/7 support from a great support team and extra features such as a redirect manager, recommended internal links, tutorial videos and integration with Google Webmaster Tools!

Near the 23 minute mark, Choyce shows conceptual images of what the customization experience could be like when implemented with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>In the experimental images, you can see options to choose page templates or layouts, live previewing changes to blocks, global site styles, and a standard set of user interface patterns.

I&#8217;ll share what I did each time the growing business started to threaten my lifestyle, and how you can do the same.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>I had a traditional full-time job throughout my 20’s. I enjoyed building my career and earning a regular salary, but didn’t like the lack of flexibility that came with it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t like having to arrive at work by a fixed time, or being unable to choose when I worked. As a hard-working person, it felt counter-productive to be forced to work set hours when I may not be at my best.</p>\n<p>My daily commute was anything from 25-50 minutes (which I realise is less than many people). It felt like a waste of time as I could work just as well from home, not to mention the environmental impact of driving so far just to sit in an office. Day-to-day tasks such as ordering items for home delivery became a big deal, as I wasn’t home during the day.</p>\n<p>As a result, I spent most of my 20’s simultaneously building my career in a traditional job, while dreaming about running my own business and working for myself. Andy felt the same about his own job as a senior software developer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think that most people want a better lifestyle, but not many actually do anything about it. I thought I was one of those people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andy and I would talk endlessly about different business ideas (most of them terrible!) and even experimented with building a few websites that were never launched. However, we didn’t have the drive to make it happen and launch a business in the real world.</p>\n<h2>Starting a Business</h2>\n<p>In late 2009, Andy had finally had enough of his job and we agreed that it was time for him to quit. We decided to start a web design business together. He would work solely on the new business, while I would support it alongside my main job (which I didn&#8217;t hate, even though I didn&#8217;t like the lifestyle).</p>\n<p>We started by building WordPress websites for small local businesses. Andy built the websites and I was responsible for copywriting and marketing. We approached local tradespeople who didn&#8217;t already have a website &#8211; back in 2010, there were still a lot of these! Our first clients were local plumbers, electricians, a washing machine repair shop, etc.</p>\n<p>These early projects were quite low budget. The average hourly rate was quite low because we were still learning and hadn&#8217;t perfected our processes yet. We wasted a lot of time on projects where we had under-quoted but were committed to honoring the agreed price.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We made a lot of mistakes, and learned from them all!</p></blockquote>\n<p>By Year 2, the business was making the equivalent of a fairly low salary for one person. However, we had to work a lot for a relatively small income. This encouraged us to work more hours, and it wasn&#8217;t bringing the lifestyle benefits I was looking for.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #1: Learn to Specialize</h2>\n<p>In late 2010, it occurred to me that we were building all our websites in WordPress but not advertising ourself as a WordPress company. I wondered whether people were actually searching for WordPress experts and whether this could be a good way to advertise. That may seem obvious in 2018 now WordPress is the world&#8217;s biggest web platform &#8211; but it was a genuine question back in 2010.</p>\n<p>On a whim, I invested $100 in Google AdWords targeting keywords such as &#8216;WordPress web design&#8217; and &#8216;WordPress developer&#8217;. Amazingly, we were overwhelmed with enquiries and quickly brought in over $4,000 of business &#8211; not a bad return on investment! The work came from medium sized companies who had never used our services before, with higher budgets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Positioning ourselves as WordPress specialists completely changed the profile of our client base, as well as the budgets we were working with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This vastly increased our average hourly income, so we were making more money without having to work more hours. Finally, it felt like a proper business with a better work-life balance.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #2: Build a (virtual) team</h2>\n<p>The business grew quickly under its new identity as a specialist WordPress agency. By mid-2011, we had more work than we could manage ourselves. I also had a baby and increased my hours on the business while on maternity leave &#8211; eventually not returning to my old job. We still needed to increase the company&#8217;s income, while working towards the lifestyle we wanted.</p>\n<p>We grew the business to the next level by building a virtual team.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt quite strongly that I didn&#8217;t want to become a traditional employer with a team of staff, all working together in an office. That would bring me back to the lifestyle I started with!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead, I decided to recruit a team of freelancers.</p>\n<p>It took time to find the right freelancers, but the good news is that you can try someone out on a single project with no further commitment. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, then you don&#8217;t have to work with them again. Through trial and error, I built a team of freelancers with different WordPress-related skills. This increased capacity and allowed us to take on more projects without having to work more hours.</p>\n<p>I was still managing all the projects, but could take a step back and wasn&#8217;t directly building the websites. Finally, it felt like a proper WordPress agency.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle Tip #3: Selling WordPress products</h2>\n<p>By building a distributed team, the business became more and more successful. We were taking on more and more projects, and I was managing all of them. By the time we were running 20 projects at once, I had reached the limits of my capacity and was having to work a lot of hours.</p>\n<p>From 2014-15, I experimented with working with freelance project managers, but had to give up because quality was dropping and our clients were less happy. I realised that with the current business model, I could only continue growing the business by working more and more hours. This wasn&#8217;t what I had been working towards!</p>\n<p>It was time for Andy and I to pursue our other dream: selling WordPress products. We&#8217;d been talking about this since the early days of the business, but the client projects had kept us so busy that we&#8217;d never done anything about it.</p>\n<p>In early 2016, Andy stepped out of the client business and started writing WordPress and WooCommerce plugins to sell. I continued managing client projects for the next 6 months, until the plugins were making enough money to stop taking on new projects and I could spend all my time marketing and supporting the plugins.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Selling WordPress plugins has been very successful because we already knew the market inside out from our years of developing WordPress sites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We knew where the gaps were and what plugin customers want. We knew where other plugin companies get it wrong, and could learn from their mistakes without making the same mistakes ourselves!</p>\n<p>By launching several plugins, we could listen to what our customers were asking for and build even more. In October 2016, we launched our <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/\">WooCommerce Product Table plugin</a> because so many people asked for a way to list products in a table with add to cart buttons. This immediately became our bestselling plugin and has sold more than all our other plugins combined. Since then, the plugin business has gone from strength to strength.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have found that selling WordPress products brings a much better work-life balance than providing WordPress services.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We receive (many) plugin support requests every day, but each one takes relatively little time and is less pressured than fixing problems for web design clients. The whole business feels much more relaxed, and I don&#8217;t feel guilty about taking time off.</p>\n<p>Between the two of us, we spend a couple of hours a day on plugin support. We continue improving the plugins, marketing, adding features and building the business on top of that. However, all of this is optional and can easily be done while working part-time.</p>\n<h2>Snow Day! Putting It Into Practice</h2>\n<p>Before we finish, I&#8217;ll tell you about my week. Today is Friday. At 10.30am on Wednesday, I received a text that my daughter&#8217;s school had closed for the rest of the week because of the unusual snow here in the UK.</p>\n<p>The parents with traditional jobs panicked and had to quickly arrange childcare or time-off work. Some of them were stuck in cars on snowed-in roads as they tried to return to the village. No one could get to work the next day. A lot of people lost a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Andy and I simply stopped work, put on our snow gear, walked the 10 minutes to the school, and then went sledging. Since then, we&#8217;ve been sharing the childcare in between responding to plugin support requests (and writing this article!). We&#8217;ve had 37 plugin sales on our website since the school closed, even though we&#8217;ve been working less hours than usual. Now, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been working towards!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked hard and have been extremely committed to building Barn2 Media. However, this has always been on the condition that it wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice my lifestyle goals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the ideal business is measured against a combination of financial success and lifestyle benefits. If the founders are working 70 hours a week to keep the money coming in, then it&#8217;s not a successful business!</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can do the same. Design a WordPress business that will give you the lifestyle you want, as well as making money. If you love working with people, build a team and provide WordPress services (WordPress design and development are good for this). If you want to travel, choose work that you can do remotely from different time zones (WordPress products are good for this). Plan your business around what matters to you.</p>\n<p>WordPress is such a huge ecosystem that it comes with many opportunities to build a successful business. With a bit of extra thought and planning, you can build a WordPress business that is successful AND lets you life the lifestyle you&#8217;ve always wanted. That is the true measure of success.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Building A New Life\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20A%20New%20Life&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Building A New Life\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-a-new-life%2F&title=Building+A+New+Life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Building A New Life\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/030718-150x150.jpg&description=Building A New Life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Building A New Life\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/\" title=\"Building A New Life\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/\">Building A New Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Mar 2018 08:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Katie Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: WordPress Now Used on 30% of the Top 10 Million Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78214\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-now-used-on-30-of-the-top-10-million-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2379:\"<p><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/\">W3Techs</a>, a survey company that monitors usage of various web technologies, <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">is reporting</a> that WordPress has reached 30% usage or 60.2% market share of all the websites whose content management systems it knows about.

It turned out to be a complex, obscure vulnerability that ignited a conversation surrounding the security of api.wordpress.org and what could happen if the servers were compromised.</p>\n<p>One idea that was brought forth is to digitally sign WordPress core, theme, and plugin updates. For at least five years, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25052\">a trac ticket</a> has laid semi-dormant with this idea in mind.</p>\n<p>Fifteen months ago, Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, who is most widely known for his <a href=\"https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/02/cryptographically-secure-php-development\">cryptography engineering work</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871\">published an article</a> that has since been taken down, expressing his strong desire for Matt Mullenweg to make secure cryptographic signatures a priority. Mullenweg responded to his post with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1\">one of his own</a> stating that although WordPress update signing is important, it&#8217;s not a high priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help,&#8221; Mullenweg responded when asked if WordPress was ever going to do update signing. &#8220;There are, however, some more important security issues in front of it, that impact millions of sites in the real world, so we are prioritizing those issues above a nice-to-have, defense in-depth effort.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Eric Mann Launches Secure WordPress Updates Plugin</h2>\n<p>While WordPress does not digitally sign updates, Eric Mann, founder of <a href=\"https://displace.tech/\">Displace Technologies, LLC</a>, has <a href=\"https://ttmm.io/tech/introducing-secure-updates-for-wordpress/\">created and released</a> a new plugin that adds code signing to WordPress core updates. It&#8217;s called DGXPCO or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/dgxpco/\">Digital Guarantees for eXplicitly Permitted Core Operations</a>. You&#8217;ll find it on the plugin directory by searching for DGXPCO.</p>\n<p>When installed and activated, the plugin integrates with the core updater and requires that any core update must have a valid signature before it can be installed. The signature provides a secondary source of truth that confirms the integrity of the files. The signatures are created using a Ed25519 public/private keypair and <a href=\"https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium\">Libsodium</a> to sign the files’ contents.</p>\n<p>Mann keeps the private key offline and has published the public key online. The public key will not change and if a core update is signed by a different key, it is a red flag and the update should be avoided. In addition, commits made to the <a href=\"https://github.com/DisplaceTech/release-hashes\">release hashes repository</a> on GitHub are signed with <a href=\"https://keybase.io/eamann\">Mann&#8217;s PGP key</a> to verify that he is the one who added new code.</p>\n<p>Mann admits that the solution is not fool-proof and is working towards improving it. In future versions, the plugin will only notify the user of a WordPress core update if a digital signature is available. Plugins and themes are on the roadmap as well with the ability to opt-in.</p>\n<p>Although he is the only person allowed to digitally sign packages, the model is not sustainable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I prove out the update system, I’ll also begin adding sets of public keys that are scoped to specific sets of packages,&#8221; Mann said. &#8220;This will, for example, allow me to whitelist a small number of trusted developers to also sign core packages. It might also empower plugin developers to sign their own releases (but not anyone else’s).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mann is seeking feedback and is hoping the project provides evidence that something like it can be added to WordPress core.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Mar 2018 00:56:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: Marketing and positioning WordPress products — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=44157\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://poststatus.com/marketing-positioning-wordpress-products-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2776:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Without it, users will experience unnecessary frustration and hamper enthusiasm of the new editor. In an effort to figure out what plugins are already compatible with Gutenberg, Daniel Bachhuber <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/01/introducing-the-gutenberg-plugin-compatibility-database/\">has created</a> a <a href=\"https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/\">Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database</a>.</p>\n<img />Gutenberg Plugin Compatibility Database\n<p>The database contains 5,000 plugins that represent more than 90% of the total active install count. Plugins are compatible with Gutenberg if they meet the following two requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A WordPress user can perform the same functional task with Gutenberg active. For instance, if the plugin includes an &#8216;Add Media&#8217; button, it&#8217;s considered Gutenberg-compatible when it has a block registered for the Gutenberg inserter.</li>\n<li>There are no (obvious) errors when the WordPress plugin is active alongside Gutenberg.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to participate in the testing process, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://plugincompat.danielbachhuber.com/#account-details/\">register an account</a> on the site. Once approved, testers will be able to create a fresh sandboxed WordPress install on the site and test randomly selected plugins. After a manual review is complete, plugins will be marked as <code>is_compatible=yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=no</code>.</p>\n<p>Some plugins are already classified with <code>is_compatible=likely_yes</code> or <code>is_compatible=likely_</code>. As reports are completed, two pie charts that display compatibility results at the bottom of the site update automatically.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber estimates that if each plugin takes about a minute to test, they&#8217;ll need roughly 75 person-hours to get through the remaining 4,500 plugins in the database. This project is a great opportunity for individuals and businesses to contribute back to WordPress via the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/\">Five for The Future initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Ideal testers are those who can review dozens of plugins, but even reviewing a few will help the project.

There have been a lot of interesting new developments, so read on to see what the community has been up to for the past month.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>WordPress 4.9.3 &amp; 4.9.4</h2>\n\n<p>Early in the month, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-3-maintenance-release/\">version 4.9.3 of WordPress was released</a>, including a number of important bug fixes. Unfortunately it introduced a bug that prevented many sites from automatically updating to future releases. To remedy this issue, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/\">version 4.9.4 was released</a> the following day requiring many people to manually update their sites.</p>\n\n<p>While this kind of issue is always regrettable, the good thing is that it was fixed quickly, and that not all sites had updated to 4.9.3 yet, which meant they bypassed the bug in that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more technical information about this issue <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/\">on the Core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator is Back</h2>\n\n<p>In 2016, the Global Community Team ran an experimental program to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event. This program was dubbed the WordCamp Incubator, and it was so successful in the three cities where it ran that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordcamp-incubator-2-0/\">the program is back for 2018</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Community Team is looking for cities to be a part of this year’s incubator by <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application\">taking applications</a>. Additionally, each incubator community will need an experienced WordCamp organizer to assist them as a co-lead organizer for their event — if that sounds interesting to you, then you can <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-co-lead-application\">fill in the application form for co-leads</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out further information about the WordCamp Incubator <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/19/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-announcement/\">on the Community Team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordPress Meetup Roundtables scheduled for March</h2>\n\n<p>In order to assist local WordPress meetup organizers with running their meetup groups, some members of the Community Team have organized <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/23/wordpress-meetup-roundtables-scheduled-for-march/\">weekly meetup roundtable discussions through the month of March</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These will be run as video chats at 16:00 UTC every Wednesday this month and will be a great place for meetup organizers to come together and help each other out with practical ideas and advice.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not already in the WordPress meetup program and would like to join, you can find out more information in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the WordPress Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core</h2>\n\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an upcoming regulation that will affect all online services across Europe. In order to prepare for this, a working group has been formed to make sure that WordPress is compliant with the GDPR regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the fact that this will be a requirement for the project going forward, it will also have an important and significant impact on the privacy and security of WordPress as a whole. The working group has posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">their proposed roadmap</a> for this project and it looks very promising.</p>\n\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #gdpr-compliance channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>WPShout published <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/complete-guide-wordpress-security/\">a thorough guide to WordPress security</a>.</li>\n    <li>The Community Team has published interesting statistics from the WordCamp program in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/27/wordcamps-in-2016/\">2016</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/28/wordcamps-in-2017/\">2017</a>.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/02/15/potential-addition-of-a-new-onboarding-team/\">An intriguing proposal has been made</a> for a new ‘Onboarding’ team to be started in the WordPress project.</li>\n    <li>The new editing experience for WordPress, named Gutenberg, continues to be actively developed with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-16th-february/\">a feature-packed release</a> this past month.</li>\n    <li>The Advanced WordPress Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vS_jR5-nIo\">held an interview with WordPress co-founder, Matt Mullenweg</a> about the Gutenberg project.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2018/02/27/two-factor-authentication-on-wp-org/\">Two factor authentication is on its way to the WordPress.org network</a> — this will be a great improvement to the overall security of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Mar 2018 08:41:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 306 – AMP, GDPR, and Brewing Beer At The Boss’ House\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=78185&preview=true&preview_id=78185\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-306-amp-gdpr-and-brewing-beer-at-the-boss-house\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1707:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> joins me live from Hutchinson, KS, to talk about the news of the week.

We came up with some changes that feel deeply satisfying. Changes we think should help HeroPress, help readers, and help us as content producers. So here we go.</p>\n<h3>Financial Changes</h3>\n<p>At various times in the past people have told me that the time I spend on HeroPress is worth compensation. When I first started it as a blog, I had no intention of getting money from it. However, being compensated for my time helped ease the burden on my family.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With that in mind, last fall I test-drove a donation page based on interest from some in the community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a good idea, and I’m thankful for the support I received, but for now it’s not the right path.</p>\n<p>So, I’ve pulled the donation page from the site and am no longer accepting site sponsors. You’ll notice I do have a Sponsorship page, but it lists organizations that have made material contributions like hosting, plugins, etc.</p>\n<h3>Content Changes</h3>\n<p>We’ve been publishing every Wednesday for several years now. Over time, readership has climbed quite a bit. That’s great, but it means that many current readers have never seen the earlier content, which remains quite evergreen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To address this, we’re going to do new HeroPress essays once a month. The other weeks of the month will be replays of earlier essays.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This allows for some breathing room in gathering new contributors and brings back some really great content that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>\n<p>It also opens up my time to explore the community more. To see if there are new ways that people, particularly on the fringe, can be helped. Sharing stories is useful, but are there other opportunities and needs we’re missing?</p>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<p>So HeroPress will continue. I still love doing it. At various times we’ve discussed making it bigger, doing grand things. But not now. For now we’re going to let it grow organically and continue letting it serve its purpose: to give voice to WordPress stories, to make them known, to inspire.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Changes Coming To HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Changes%20Coming%20To%20HeroPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Changes Coming To HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fchanges-coming-heropress%2F&title=Changes+Coming+To+HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Changes Coming To HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/\" title=\"Changes Coming To HeroPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/changes-coming-heropress/\">Changes Coming To HeroPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:00:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: New Team Forms to Facilitate GDPR Compliance in WordPress Core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=78149\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/new-team-forms-to-facilitate-gdpr-compliance-in-wordpress-core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6200:\"<p>As May 25th, the enforcement date for the <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org/\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) draws near, individuals and businesses are scrambling to make sure they&#8217;re compliant. I&#8217;ve read a number of blog posts throughout the WordPress community explaining the GDPR and what needs to be done for compliance and it&#8217;s a tough thing to grasp.</p>\n<p>The EU GDPR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, protect and empower European citizens data privacy, and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. In reading the regulation and various blog posts, the terminology makes it appear that the changes are geared towards large, international businesses that process personal data.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/\">according to Heather Burns</a>, a digital law specialist in Glasgow, Scotland, the GDPR affects sites large and small.</p>\n<blockquote><p>GDPR applies to all businesses, organizations, sectors, situations, and scenarios, regardless of a business’s size, head count, or financial turnover. A small app studio is every bit as beholden to these rules as a large corporation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Determining if your site needs to be compliant and how to accomplish it can be overwhelming. If you do business in Europe or collect data from European users, you must protect that data in accordance with the GDPR as if you were in Europe. For example, if you operate a blog with a contact form that saves entries to the database from people who live in Europe, you must make your site GDPR compliant.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of aspects to the GDPR and while an excerpt can not fully explain it at a glance, there are a few themes that stick out to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be upfront and concise about what data is stored, sent, and used on the site or form.</li>\n<li>Give the user a chance to consent without automatically opting them in.</li>\n<li>Collect the least amount of data possible for legitimate business purposes.</li>\n<li>Provide a way for users to download or access their data and remove it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these are common sense practices that are not implemented on many sites, WP Tavern included. How often do you visit a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/contact-me\">site&#8217;s contact form</a> and see an explanation as to why those fields are required, where the data is stored, where it goes, and what is done with it? This is something I&#8217;ll be working on in the next few weeks.</p>\n<h2>Making WordPress Core GDPR Compliant</h2>\n<p>Earlier <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/13/gdpr-compliance-agenda-february-14/\">this month</a>, a number of volunteers gathered to discuss GDPR compliance in WordPress core. The meeting took place in a newly created channel #gdpr-compliance that&#8217;s accessible to anyone with a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">SlackHQ account</a>.</p>\n<p>The team created a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/19/proposed-roadmap-tools-for-gdpr-compliance/\">proposed roadmap</a> to add privacy tools to core. The plan includes the following ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add notices for registered users and commenters on what data is collected in core by default and explain why.</li>\n<li>Create guidelines for plugins on how to become GDPR compliant.</li>\n<li>Create and add tools to facilitate compliance and privacy in general.</li>\n<li>Add documentation and help for site owners to learn how to use these tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1519227959000760\">Earlier today</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/27/gdpr-compliance-chat-recap-february-21st/\">the team met</a> and created a <a href=\"https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info\">GitHub folder</a> that houses the roadmap, knowledge base, trac ticket list, and other items associated with the project. There was also some discussion on whether the interface provided by the <a href=\"https://www.gdprwp.com/\">GDPR for WordPress project</a> is a good foundation for core and plugins to report personal data. The GDPR Compliance Slack channel is also a good place to ask questions and discuss data privacy in general.</p>\n<p>Popular form plugins such as <a href=\"https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/\">GravityForms</a> and <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/gdpr-compliance-wordpress-forms/\">NinjaForms</a> have documentation available that explains GDPR compliance and how it applies to their products. For those who use the Contact Form module in Jetpack which <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/8430\">saves entries to the database by default</a>, you&#8217;ll need to wait for further updates. <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/12/gdpr-compliance-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a> and <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/\">Automattic</a> have announced that they expect their products will be GDPR compliant by the time it goes into effect later this year.</p>\n<h2>GDPR Resources</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like me, reading about the GDPR and its policies can make your head spin. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that at the heart of the GDPR are common sense behaviors for handling personal data.

The interview concludes the <a href=\"http://www.advancedwp.org/awp-gutenberg-interview-series/\">Advanced WordPress Gutenberg interview series</a> that includes, <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/06/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-joost-de-valk/\">Joost de Valk</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2018/02/18/awp-gutenberg-interview-series-with-ahmad-awais/\">Ahmad Awais</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ic_du_lsbLE\">Tammie Lister</a>.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg began the session by explaining why there is a concerted effort to improve the editor. &#8220;It&#8217;s really almost any user test that you watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both watching people brand new to WordPress and those with years of experience on how they used the editor. It became obvious that we could make something more accessible to new users, but also, a lot more powerful for developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With regards to a release date, Mullenweg confirmed that Gutenberg will ship when it&#8217;s ready. Later in the interview, Mullenweg was asked if he could provide a more concrete answer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For those who want a concrete date, we will have one or two orders of magnitude more users of Gutenberg in April,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean necessarily a 5.0 release, but it does mean that if you&#8217;re planning on aiming for something where a lot of users will be interacting with Gutenberg, aim for April.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the project&#8217;s name is Gutenberg, some developers have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4681\">expressed concerns</a> on how the name will be deprecated if at all once it&#8217;s merged into core. There are a number of educational resources, products, and tool kits referencing Gutenberg that could be a source of confusion once it&#8217;s merged into core and referred to as the editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg was asked if the Gutenberg name will be deprecated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most important thing to figure out right now. We&#8217;re tackling some much bigger issues. If the plugin is useful, we&#8217;ll keep it around for beta testing, if not, we&#8217;ll have it turn itself off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the interview thanking the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/\">Advanced WordPress Facebook</a> group for the passion and discussions shared by members. The group has more than 30K members, is free to join, well maintained, and often filled with interesting topics.

They are born out of active WordPress meetup groups that meet regularly and are able to host an annual WordCamp event. This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can’t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen. To address this, we introduced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/\">the WordCamp Incubator program</a> in 2016.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The goal of the incubator program is <strong>to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event.</strong> In 2016, members of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">the global community team</a> worked with volunteers in three cities — Denpasar, Harare and Medellín — giving direct, hands-on assistance in making local WordCamps possible. All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application\"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don’t need to have any specific information handy, it’s just a form to let us know you’re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"HeroPress: How To Build A Company With WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2465\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://heropress.com/essays/build-company-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-company-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16946:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/022118-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: If you keep showing up, you\'d be surprised what happens.\" />.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n<div class=\"embed-container\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Full text of the above video</h4>\n<p>Hey, y&#8217;all! Thanks for inviting me to come share my story on HeroPress. I&#8217;m so excited to be able to talk a little bit to the HeroPress community.</p>\n<p>So, and I&#8217;m doing a video blog or vlog because this is what I do; I&#8217;m a YouTube person. I create YouTube videos every single Wednesday for what I call WordPress Wednesday to help you improve your online marketing inside of the WordPress world. So I&#8217;m used to doing videos, and I asked if I could do my HeroPress story in this format; and they said go for it, so I&#8217;m excited to talk to you at least in a face-to-face scenario.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to  share a little bit of my story and tell you how WordPress basically became my avenue for becoming a millionaire in just five short years.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>So in 1998, I created my very first ever HTML website. My dad was actually doing websites at the time, and I needed a website for my band because that&#8217;s what I wanted to be is a rockstar; so I learned how to build a website, kind of, under his training and a little bit of self-taught stuff and had a lot of fun doing it that way in 1998.</p>\n<p>And then in 2005, I started hearing about WordPress; but in 2008, as I was freelancing around, a client asked me to build him a website. And they said, &#8220;hey, Kori, can you, can you build me a website, but we absolutely have to have it on WordPress?&#8221; I was like, sure, no problem; straight to Google, &#8220;how do you build a WordPress website&#8221;, you know. And over the weekend I pretty much taught myself how to build out a WordPress website, and I loved it.</p>\n<p>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns, and a form builder; I was just blown away. So those of you who have struggled in the HTML CSS world, you know the magic or the majesty, if you will even, of WordPress and those environments and how easy it makes it. So when I saw that, I really just thought, oh my goodness, this is a full-circle moment for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really want to use WordPress now from here on forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I reached back out to my dad and said, &#8220;hey, dad, you know, this is a tool that our customers, all of our clients, have been asking us for&#8221;. They&#8217;ve been wanting access to their websites, and we&#8217;ve not been able to give it to them because, in the past, they had to download Dreamweaver, you know, Photoshop and an FTP program; and that was just too much nerd code for them. So we wanted to be able to give them something like this, and WordPress definitely was that solution.</p>\n<p>So he and I worked back and forth for a few years learning, really truly learning, WordPress; and then in 2012, we decided to launch together, my mom, my dad and I, decided to launch WebTegrity in San Antonio, Texas. And it was a very small concept initially; you know, we just me, literally, the three of us, and me and my folks. And then we hired on a subcontractor who is a great graphic designer here in town to try to help us with the creative side of things, and we started to grow our team.</p>\n<h3>Going Big Time</h3>\n<p>So how did we, in five years, build it up in such a way that we were able to sell it for a deal of a million dollars&#8217; worth of shares, which ultimately is a $20 million value deal? How did we do that? I&#8217;m going to give you a little bit of insight on how we were able to accomplish that in such a short time.</p>\n<p>So the very first thing I want you to realize is we did this in a saturated industry in San Antonio, Texas. When I did a search for web developer or web design firms back in 2012, I had over 700 results of different either freelancers or agencies or ad agencies or some solution out there that was either in the general area, or in the nearby area, that provided that service. So how did we, in six years, end up becoming number six in the entire city? We ranked in the top 10; how did we do that?</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the very first things we did, was we niched ourselves; and, thankfully, WordPress was that solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2012, there was not an agency directly in San Antonio that was trying to be the go-to place for WordPress; and we purposely started stepping up and saying we are WordPress only, WordPress only, WordPress only. So if you were looking for a different type of CMS solution, we were not the right fit for you. And very, very quickly, we also started teaching it in the city; so we would teach other agencies. We provided on-site training; we provided weekend workshops. All for a price tag, of course; but that was one of our revenue streams. And, again, it set us as the authority in the city for WordPress; so really important that you understand how to niche yourselves and not try to be all things to all people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The second thing we tried to do was really build a culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And you can see, I don&#8217;t work around boring walls. Everything that I do has to have creative juices flowing around me, right. We just want to create a great culture, a great environment. So we had to hire the right people. So that&#8217;s my next tip to you is be very, very careful on who you allow into your culture of your business, who you hire on, and certainly who you bring on as a leader in your culture in your community. So one of the things that we did right away was realize that we can&#8217;t teach passion, so you gotta find people that have a passion to nerd out on stuff like this.</p>\n<p>And you have to find people who have great integrity to just do their best at all times, and you have to find people who love to be creative and love to solve problems for clients, right, who aren&#8217;t just salespeople, right? So if you can find those things, you can teach nerd code all day long; so be sure to just find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way, be sure that you just grow and grow and grow your culture in a healthy way, right.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And another thing that we did, so this is another tip, was understand how to really build a revenue stream that was going to be sustainable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All right, so wrap your heads around this one because this one&#8217;s key. Very early on in our model as we were selling WordPress websites, part of my pitch was, oh, it&#8217;s just five grand and no more after that. It&#8217;s a one-time fee and you&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s a horrible business strategy. We learned very early on, inside of WordPress world, that you have rain or shine, right; so there&#8217;s a lot of clients coming or there are no clients.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re either slammed working from home even in the evening trying to catch up, or you&#8217;re out on the golf course wondering if you&#8217;re going to get a paycheck next week. It&#8217;s really rain or shine. So how do you create a sustainable model in your business, in your small agency, in your startup; how do you do that, so that when those slow seasons come, you can still pay your team members, you can still keep your lights on?</p>\n<p>Well, we were sitting at a WordCamp; and Jason Cohen from WP Engine was keynoting; and one of the things he said right away is, if you don&#8217;t understand how to create a reoccurring revenue stream in your small agency, you will turn your sign to closed in the next year or two. And he was so right; and it was such a light bulb moment for me that I went back straightaway from that weekend WordCamp up in Austin and I started writing out, okay, how can we create a reoccurring revenue stream? What would that look like inside of our industry?</p>\n<p>And, of course, it was support packages. We didn&#8217;t call them maintenance plans. We certainly didn&#8217;t use retainer, which can have a sense of a negative connotation, right, because of lawyers; sorry! But, still, we didn&#8217;t want to use those words because we&#8217;re already almost creating a, uh, I don&#8217;t think I want to sign up for that type of attitude.</p>\n<p>What we did is we called it support, and very easily, clients were signing up saying, oh, goodness, yes, I need that ongoing support. So use that phrasing, create a model structure where it&#8217;s required, at least for the first 12 months out of the gate as they launch that you are charging them something even as small as $99 a month. And don&#8217;t shortchange yourself on that; put together a great package that you give them that type of value.</p>\n<p>If you were to check out WebTegrity.com, you would see our support plans and what they consist of and the pricing. We&#8217;re very transparent with that. That&#8217;s the way our revenue stream almost doubled our sales in one year and allowed us to keep our lights on when June and July roll around and nobody cares about their websites because they&#8217;re on the beach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All right, reputation was another huge part of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we named ourselves WebTegrity, but reputation, understanding that that every client that signs up, whether they&#8217;re a $5,000 website or a $50,000 website gets the same type of boutique-style, white glove, handholding relationship, right? Every single project that you launch, you want to produce the absolute, absolute best. You&#8217;re not shortchanging them; you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not wiring something that you hand off to the client and hope to God it doesn&#8217;t break. You really are trying to find the absolute best solution.</p>\n<p>One of the things that also kept us in high standing with our reputation, of course, was offering that training because what we don&#8217;t want to do is keep the veil covered where nobody can see what we&#8217;re doing, right. We really want to be transparent and train our clients the nerd lingo, train the clients what SEO is and what expectations should be. Having that type of open communication really just started to build together a relationship with our clients that they trusted us; and we met their expectation, right. So be sure to hold strongly to your core values for your reputation. Be sure that you&#8217;re asking people to give you great reviews because that&#8217;ll make a difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And the last thing I want to talk about is give back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at one of the WordCamp US&#8217;s that I went to, Matt himself said, listen, if you&#8217;re making a living with WordPress, you really need to try to figure out how to give back 5% of your time, just 5% of your time a week. How can you do that to give back to the community? Can you start a meet-up group, teach a meetup group; can you facilitate a meetup group where maybe you&#8217;re just the organizer and you never have to speak because you&#8217;re not a fan of speaking?</p>\n<p>Can you organize a WordCamp, volunteer at a WordCamp? Can you write a tutorial and tell people how to do things? Can you teach a workshop; can you make a video?</p>\n<p>And, again, I had a light bulb moment. Of course, I can make videos. So my giveback to the WordPress community is my YouTube channel; every single Wednesday, I&#8217;m creating a video and putting it out there for free to the WordPress world of how to improve your online marketing. That&#8217;s made a huge impact not only, thankfully, inside the WordPress community, but also in my own business model.</p>\n<p>I actually go into WordCamps around the US and people are like, hey, aren&#8217;t you that WordPress girl; don&#8217;t you do videos? It&#8217;s a really cool feeling to be able to give back to the community because I&#8217;ve made my living using WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>So ultimately how did I turn five years into a multi-million dollar buyout? Because we have just recently sold; how did we do that? Ultimately, it was understanding that you have to be able to grow something of value. So as soon as you start your business, you should also be thinking about your exit strategy, right, even in how you name your company.</p>\n<p>If I were to name this Ashton Agency, do you think that I could&#8217;ve just walked away and handed the keys to somebody else named Johnson; it wouldn&#8217;t have worked. Think even about your name; will it stand alone? Can that become a brand that you can hand off and sell as a holistic entity?</p>\n<p>You also want to think about that revenue stream, right, and watch those sales margins. Be sure that your margins are healthy. Don&#8217;t hire until it hurts, until it absolutely hurts. Be sure that you&#8217;re structuring your offerings in such a way that you&#8217;re actually recouping your value. What does that mean? Just understand business better; watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials like this, watch more videos.</p>\n<p>Get a hold of the WordPress community, the core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and trying to understand what it is that they&#8217;re training and teaching. There&#8217;s a lot of resources out there for you to gain some ideas from, but ultimately it was me stepping out in the San Antonio community because it was a larger firm here in San Antonio who purchased us.</p>\n<p>So we just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training; we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events; and people kept seeing us. We kept showing up, so you&#8217;d be surprised what happens. If you keep giving back and you keep showing up to places, you keep establishing yourself as the authority, you keep learning and training and growing your own skill set and growing your team, before you know it, it can happen for you.</p>\n<p>I hope this has been helpful.

You don&#8217;t need to support every version of WordPress, and you don&#8217;t have to support every version of PHP. Feel free to do this for seemingly selfish reasons. Supporting old versions is hard. You have to &#8220;unlearn&#8221; new WordPress and PHP features and use their older equivalents, or even have code branches that do version/feature checks. It increases your development and testing time. It increases your support burden.</p>\n<p>Economics might force your hand here&#8230; a bit. You can&#8217;t very well, even in 2018, require that everyone be running PHP 7.1 and the latest version of WordPress. But consider the following:</p>\n<p>97% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.3 or higher. This gives you namespaces, late static binding, closures, Nowdoc, <strong>__DIR</strong><strong>__</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>88% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.4 or higher. This gives you short array syntax, traits, function-array dereferencing, guaranteed <strong>&lt;?=</strong> echo syntax availability, <strong>$this</strong> access in closures, and more.</p>\n<p>You get even more things with PHP 5.5 and 5.6 (64% of installs are running 5.6 or higher), but a lot of the syntactic goodness came in 5.3 and 5.4, with very few people running versions less than 5.4. So stop typing <strong>array()</strong>, stop writing named function handlers for simple <strong>array_map()</strong> uses, and start using namespaces to organize and simplify your code.</p>\n<p>Okay, so&#8230; how?</p>\n<p>I recommend that your main plugin file just be a simple bootstrapper, where you define your autoloader, do a few checks, and then call a method that initializes your plugin code. I also recommend that this main plugin file be PHP 5.2 compatible. This should be easy to do (just be careful not to use <strong>__DIR__</strong>).</p>\n<p>In this file, you should check the minimum PHP and WordPress versions that you are going to support. And if the minimums are not reached, have the plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not initialize (you don&#8217;t want syntax errors).</li>\n<li>Display an admin notice saying which minimum version was not met.</li>\n<li>Deactivate itself (optional).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not <strong>die()</strong> or <strong>wp_die()</strong>. That&#8217;s &#8220;rude&#8221;, and a bad user experience. Your goal here is for them to update WordPress or ask their host to move them off an ancient version of PHP, so be kind.</p>\n<p>Here is what I use:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/markjaquith/a08623974b37c2cf0207ee2b120b54da\">View code on GitHub</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markjaquith/status/965605448408813569\">Reach out on Twitter</a> and let me know what methods you use to manage PHP and WordPress versions in your plugin!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href=\"https://coveredwebservices.com/\">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href=\"https://coveredwebservices.com/\">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 15:14:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"Post Status: How WebDevStudios is serving different market segments — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=43724\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://poststatus.com/webdevstudios-serving-different-market-segments-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2637:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

WebDevStudios focuses heavily on the upper and enterprise market segments, providing a high degree of attention and support to those clients.</p>\n<p>Sometime in 2017 Lisa did the math on all the lower-end projects that they were referring away and realized that WDS had a prime opportunity to re-introduce her former web studio, eWebscapes, as a way to serve these smaller-scope projects. This rebirth, so to speak, has positioned them to better target local communities, provide staff with more variety of work, and bring simplified processes alongside those they use for larger projects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Key take-aways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lisa observed a market opportunity and did the math first</li>\n<li>Relaunching started with a solid content strategy</li>\n<li>Simplified processes for managing a project</li>\n<li>Utilized talent already on staff</li>\n<li>Lots of opportunity to target local communities</li>\n<li>Evaluating the success of this strategy after 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ewebscapes.com/\">eWebscapes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jenniferbourn.com/profitable-project-plan/\">Profitable Project Plan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@lisasabinwilson\">Lisa Sabin-Wilson on Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/about/\"><em>Photo Credit</em></a></p>\n<h3>Sponsor: Prospress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://prospress.com/\">Prospress</a> makes the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin, that enables you to turn your online business into a recurring revenue business.

You can put in your email to read I believe but it&#x27;s behind a paywall otherwise. <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/\">The Information</a> is a pretty excellent site that alongside (former Automattician) <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Ben Thompson&#x27;s Stratechery</a> I recommend subscribing to. Here are some quotes from the parts of the article that quote me or talk about <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n    <p>So it’s no coincidence that one of the first companies to operate with a distributed workforce has roots in the open source movement. Automattic, the company behind open source software tools like WordPress, was founded in 2005 and has always allowed its employees to work from anywhere. The company’s 680 employees are based in 63 countries and speak 79 languages. Last year, it closed its San Francisco office, a converted warehouse — because so few employees were using it. It still has a few coworking spaces scattered around the globe.</p>\n    <p>Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO, said that when the company first started, its employees communicated via IRC, an early form of instant messaging. Now it uses a whole host of software that’s tailor-made for remote work, and as the technology evolves, Automattic adopts what they need.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Mullenweg said Automattic only started having regular meetings, for instance, after it started using Zoom, a video conferencing tool that works even on slow internet connections.</p>\n    <p>He’s become a proponent of office-less companies and shares what he’s learned with other founders who are attempting it. Mr. Mullenweg said he believes the distributed approach has led to employees who are even more loyal to the company and that his employees especially appreciate that they don’t need to spend a chunk of their day on a commute.</p>\n    <p>“Our retention is off the charts,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n    <p>“Where it goes wrong is if they don’t have a strong network outside of work—they can become isolated and fall into bad habits,” Mr. Mullenweg said. He said he encourages employees to join groups, play sports and have friends outside of work. That kind of thing wouldn’t be a risk at big tech companies, where employees are encouraged to socialize and spend a lot of time with colleagues.</p>\n    <p>But for those who ask him about the negatives, Mr. Mullenweg offers anecdotal proof of a workaround.</p>\n    <p>For example, he said he has 14 employees in Seattle who wanted to beat the isolation by meeting up for work once a week. So they found a local bar that didn’t open until 5 p.m., pooled together the $250 per month co-working stipends that Automattic provides and convinced the bar’s owner to let them rent out the place every Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They didn&#x27;t need to pool all their co-working allowance to get the bar, I recall it was pretty cheap! Finally:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n    <p>For Automattic, flying 700 employees to places like Whistler, British Columbia or Orlando, Florida, has turned into a seven-figure expense.</p>\n    <p>“I used to joke that we save it on office space and blow it on travel. But the reality is that in-person is really important.

In a <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2018/10up-seven-year-anniversary/\">blog post celebrating the occasion</a>, Goldman reviews the previous year and highlights some notable events for the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We welcomed more than 30 new clients to our portfolio in another record sales year,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We launched new websites along with web and mobile apps for major brands across verticals as diverse as finance, healthcare, academia, high-tech, big media, consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and fitness… to name a few.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also highlighted the company&#8217;s commitment to open source and giving back to WordPress. Throughout the past year, the company has released a number of WordPress plugins and developer tools including, <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2017/distributor-plugin/\">Distributor</a>, <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2017/wp-snapshots-share-wordpress-setup/\">WP Snapshots</a>, <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2017/wp-docker/\">WP Local Docker</a>, <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2018/improving-wordpress-transients/\">Async Transients</a>, and more.</p>\n<p>Goldman describes three trends he&#8217;s noticed in the past few years.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrations with innovation happening in other projects and platforms has become increasingly important as the web matures. You see it in React.js and Vue.js emerging as popular front end standards, in the rise of Elasticsearch and NoSQL platforms, with two factor authentication and Google single sign on, with the rise of modern Asset Management Systems.</li>\n<li>For publishers, it’s increasingly becoming about distribution to multiple platforms, more so than<em> just</em> building a website. Google AMP, Facebook Articles, Apple News, Alexa, YouTube channels to name a few.</li>\n<li>If you need any more evidence of WordPress dominance, look no further than how highly in demand top-tier engineering talent is. It’s probably &#8211; literally &#8211; around a factor of 1.5x &#8211; 2x what great engineers were earning 3-4 years ago.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With seven years of experience under his belt, Goldman offers the following advice for those who are in their first or second year of running an agency or in a leadership position.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Don’t be quite so hard on yourself &#8211; when you run a business &#8211; when you’re a lease &#8211; there will always be highs and lows &#8211; don’t dwell on the lows.</li>\n<li>Put more emphasis on building systems, routines, and check-ins that offer a better pulse on the collective and individual fulfillment, engagement, and health of the team, rather than relying on transparent upwards communication.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congrats to 10up on seven years in business.

I know the birthday of more or less five people. I insist on saying that my son was born on May 11. Incorrect, I was born on May 11, he on May 17. But for some reason, my WordPress dates are permanently etched into my brain. I think it’s because meeting the global WordPress community and helping restart the Italian community are very meaningful moments in my adult life. Please join me in a walk down memory lane <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>May 15, 2015</h3>\n<p>I started building websites with WordPress in 2010: my first website was my own blog, whose only purpose was to publish photos of my son so all the grandparents could enjoy seeing him grow. I enjoyed tinkering around with it, and to my surprise someone wrote asking me to build something similar for them. And they wanted to pay me for it!</p>\n<p>For a few years I worked as an administrative manager during the day and as a web designer at night until I decided to make the jump and become a freelancer.</p>\n<p>I never thought about contributing to WordPress because I wasn’t a back end developer and I didn’t think the project needed people that were not code wizards. Heck, I didn’t even know how WordPress was made or how open source worked exactly!</p>\n<blockquote><p>And then I went to a Freelancers conference in Italy and on May 15 I gave my first talk ever.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Up until that moment I taught small classes, but I never talked in front of more than ten people. I was terrified: in the audience there were more than a hundred people. Some of my friends, but also a lot of seasoned professionals that I respected and admired, and here I was talking about how they should and shouldn’t build a website. I was so nervous, when I grabbed the mic I did such a wide gesture with my arms that the bracelet I was wearing flew through the air to the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>After my talk a guy came to compliment my talk, and I realised that he was one of those people that I respected and admired from afar: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucasartoni\">Luca Sartoni</a>, an Automattician whose blog I have been following for a while.</p>\n<p>For the three days of the event we kept chatting about websites, WordPress, entrepreneurship, open source until he convinced me to start a WordPress meetup in my hometown of Torino, Italy. He put me in contact with other people that he knew wanted to do something similar and in less than a month from that conversation we started a meetup. The group now has more than one thousand members, and in March we will celebrate thirty events.</p>\n<h3>November 7, 2015</h3>\n<p>Luca didn’t stop his proselytism in Torino <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> That same year, WordCamp Europe was held in Seville and at the Polyglots table a revolution was started. A small group of Italians, used to travelling abroad to attend WordCamps, met there and decided that it was time to organise the Italian community.</p>\n<p>The first step was to revive the blog on the Italian WordPress website: it was dormant for seven years and the first thing we did was publish the dates of meetups that were slowly but surely appearing in the whole country. At the beginning of 2015 there were two meetups in Italy, by August there were eight and their number kept growing.</p>\n<p>Now, if you have met Italians, you know we talk a lot. The two Francescos from Apulia, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/franzvitulli\">Franz Vitulli</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fra83\">Francesco Di Candia</a>, took the second initiative that was crucial to bringing us together: they opened a Slack workspace for the Italians, modeled after the UK workspace. For the whole summer we chatted every single day: about WordPress, about how to grow and manage the community that was forming in front of our eyes, how to communicate, how to contribute.</p>\n<p>And then chatting wasn’t enough, we wanted to meet in person. We wanted to put a face and a voice to the avatars. With the help of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosso\">Sara Rosso</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\">Jenny Wong</a> we carried out a bizarre plan, almost unheard of: a <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/francesca-marano-standalone-contributor-days-help-make-wordpress-with-your-community/\">stand alone WordPress Contributor Day</a>. We would meet in Milano for a day to get to know each other and to learn how to Contribute to WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I like to think that November 7 2015 is the day we became a community: we were not an abstract idea anymore, we were people, meeting in person to make WordPress in Italy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>April 10, 2016</h3>\n<p>The next few months went by in a blur of activities: the meetup organisers in Torino applied to host the first WordCamp in Italy in three years and I lead the organising team, I applied to attend the Community Summit in Philadelphia and I got accepted, I attended the first WordCamp US, my first WordCamp, and volunteered at it. I met a lot of people that helped me become more active and more focused: as a new contributor it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the abundance of amazing projects and tasks you can be part of, but it’s important to keep your focus to be more effective.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After meeting people from all over the world and sharing our experiences I realised the story of the Italian community could be inspiring for other communities and it was worth telling it to a wider audience, so I got completely out of my comfort zone and submitted a talk to WordCamp London.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On April 10th 2016 I gave <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/05/30/francesca-marano-rebirth-italian-community/\">my first talk at a WordCamp</a> and my first talk in English. I think I didn’t sleep for days before and after the event. It was nerve wracking, but I did it without throwing any bracelet in the air this time.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2457 size-large\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"641\" /></a>I gave the same talk at WordCamp Europe in 2016 and realised the story was relatable to many communities. Photographer unknown, sorry <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f641.png\" alt=\"🙁\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />\n<h3>September 17, 2017</h3>\n<p>Over the following year I kept contributing to WordPress, mostly in the Community team. I participated in the Polyglots activities for a while but then I had to pick and focus my attention. The more I interacted with people from all over the world as a hobby, the more I wanted that to become my job. Although my business as a web designer in Italy was doing good, I felt I wanted to be able to reach more people and find a way to be more involved with the community.<br />\nSo I started looking for a job. I was hesitant at first: all the insecurities I had about myself came back to haunt me. The voice in my head was telling me: you are too old, you don’t have enough technical expertise, you have been contributing for a very short time, English is not your native language, you are a single mom from Italy for crying out loud, who would want to employ you?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well, it turns out that if you actually look for a job instead of just telling yourself that you really would like a job, chances are you might get one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last September I started a new chapter in my career as the <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/blog/francesca-marano/\">WordPress Community Manager</a> at SiteGround and I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>The past 33 months have completely changed my life, personally and professionally: along the way I learned a number of lessons that I know will stay with me forever.</p>\n<h3>Step Up</h3>\n<p>If you want to achieve something, start today. Just start. Start a meetup, leave a comment to encourage someone else, volunteer to take notes of a meeting, participate in the discussion, bring your own ideas to the table. Be a fire starter, for yourself and for the people around you.</p>\n<h3>Step Back</h3>\n<p>None of the above is about you: the community is bigger than you, you are here to build a path for the future. Once you started something, don’t become too attached, let it go and let other people step up and shine. Mentor them, if they ask and if you can.</p>\n<h3>If you want to go faster go alone, if you want to go further go together</h3>\n<p>I am not a huge fan of motivational quotes, but this one is very dear to my heart and it’s one I have to remind myself quite often. I am a perfectionist and a quick learner: this is ok when you start your own business (and it’s ok only at the beginning, but this is a topic for another article!), but when you are part of a team, you are part of something bigger. It might move slower, but its impact is immensely more powerful than anything you’ll be able to achieve on your own.</p>\n<h3>Representation matters</h3>\n<p>I dislike speaking in public. When I say this people tend to laugh it off because I am good on stage. It doesn’t mean that I like it.

Gordon said. &#8220;I have a feeling a lot of folks who can&#8217;t tune live will still appreciate having all the talks available on YouTube for free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far, 15 speakers have been confirmed with more to be announced soon. The speakers include WordPress core developers, theme and plugin developers, agency owners, and educators. Some of the talks will be from designers allowing user experience and usability to be part of the conversation.</p>\n<p>Gordon says he&#8217;s been wanting to an in-person event for a while but considering the challenges involved, a virtual conference was the next best thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I used to run in-person workshops in the Washington DC area, which I miss, and have wanted to do an event for a while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But doing in-person events is so difficult, so the online format seemed like the best option to go with. I got some good advice from Human Made and WP Campus, who both have experience doing online events, so hopefully everything will go smooth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To reserve a seat and receive updates, visit the <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\">JavaScript for WordPress conference site</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 01:30:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Mark Jaquith: Updating plugins using Git and WP-CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=5552\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2018/02/12/updating-plugins-using-git-and-wp-cli/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4007:\"<p>Now that you know <a href=\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/simple-wordpress-deploys-using-git/\">how I deploy WordPress sites</a> and <a href=\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/tips-for-configuring-wordpress-environments/\">how I configure WordPress environments</a>, what about the maintenance of keeping a WordPress site&#8217;s plugins up-to-date?</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m using Git, I cannot use WordPress built-in plugin updater on the live site (and I wouldn&#8217;t want to — if a plugin update goes wrong, my live site could be in trouble!)</p>\n<p>The simple way to update all your plugins from a staging or local development site is to use WP-CLI:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">wp plugin update-all\ngit commit -am \'update all plugins\' wp-content/plugins</pre>\n<p>That works. I used to do that.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do that anymore.</p>\n<p>Why? <strong>Granularity</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of using version control like Git is that when things go wrong, you can pinpoint when they went wrong, and identify what code caused the issue.</p>\n<p>Git has a great tool called <strong>bisect</strong> that takes a known good state in the past and a current broken state, and then jumps around between revisions, efficiently, asking you to report whether that revision is <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong>. Then it tells you what revision broke your site.</p>\n<p>If you lump all your plugin updates into one commit, you won&#8217;t get that granularity. You&#8217;ll likely get the <strong>git bisect</strong> result of &#8220;great&#8230; one of EIGHTEEN PLUGINS I updated was the issue&#8221;. That doesn&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it with granularity:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">for plugin in $(wp plugin list --update=available --field=name);\ndo\n    wp plugin update $plugin &amp;&amp;\n    git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin &amp;&amp;\n    git commit -m \'update $plugin plugin\'\ndone;</pre>\n<p>This code loops through plugins with updates available, updates each one, and commits it with a message that references the plugin being updated. Great! Now <strong>git bisect</strong> will be able to tell you <strong>which</strong> plugin update broke your site.</p>\n<p>And what if you can only run WP-CLI commands from within a VM, and Git commands from your local machine? For instance, if you&#8217;re using my favorite tool, <a href=\"https://local.getflywheel.com/\">Local by Flywheel</a>, you have to SSH into the site&#8217;s container to issue WP-CLI commands, but from within that container, you might not have Git configured like it is on your host machine.</p>\n<p>So what you can do is break the process into two steps.</p>\n<p>On the VM, run this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">wp plugin list --update=available --field=name &gt; plugins.txt\nwp plugin update-all</pre>\n<p>That grabs a list of plugins with updates and writes them to a file <strong>plugins.txt</strong>, and then updates all the plugins.</p>\n<p>And then on your local machine, run this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\">while read plugin;\ndo\n    git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin &amp;&amp;\n    git commit -m \'update $plugin plugin\'\ndone; &lt; plugins.txt</pre>\n<p>That slurps in that list of updated plugins and does a distinct <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git commit</strong> for each.</p>\n<p>When that&#8217;s done, remove <b>plugins.txt</b>.</p>\n<p>All your plugins are quickly updated with WP-CLI, but you get nice granular Git commits and messages.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href=\"https://coveredwebservices.com/\">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href=\"https://coveredwebservices.com/\">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:42:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"Post Status: WordPress market opportunities: Upmarket edition — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=42360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-market-opportunities-upmarket-edition-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2284:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

They take a look at discovery projects, pitching WordPress against competing platforms, and considerations to make before pitching on these high-budget projects. There are plenty of positives and negatives when working on long-term projects that may have a dramatic impact on your company in many ways.</p>\n<p>In addition to these market opportunities, the boys also discuss recent news including iThemes acquisition by Liquid Web, a welcome change to the WordPress.org plugin directory, and an unfortunate and far-reaching bug that shipped with the 4.9.3 release last week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/liquid-web-acquired-ithemes/\">Liquid Web acquires iThemes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://generatewp.com/new-policy-changes-wordpress-plugin-directory/\">Plugin directory notice changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/\">4.9.4 technical details</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpsessions.com/sessions/infusing-websites-brand-voice/\">Infusing Websites with Brand Voice</a><a href=\"https://wpsessions.com/teams\">WPS Team Training</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: WooCommerce</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a> makes the most customizable eCommerce software on the planet, and it’s the most popular too.

In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-4-introduces-beta-version-of-new-search-module-powered-by-elasticsearch-for-professional-plan-users\">October of last year</a>, Jetpack 5.4 began beta testing a new <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/search/\">search module</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch</a>. Jetpack 5.8 concludes the beta and the new search service is available to Professional plan customers.</p>\n<p>The new search module replaces the native search functionality in WordPress and Jetpack developers claim sites with a large amount of content, images, or products will see significant speed improvements and more relevant results. Developers can fine-tune the user experience by using custom queries and template tags. Users can sort results by categories, tags, month/year, post type, or any taxonomy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Content Delivery Network, users have another method to optimize their sites with a new module named Lazy Load Images.

Naisipan kong magkaron ng pagkakataon na gumawa ng mga pelikula dahil mayroon akong nais ipahayag, meron akong mga nais na ibahagi sa mga tatangkilik na aking mga gawa. Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga festivals na kagaya ng “Cinema One Originals” at ng “Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival”, nakapagpasa ako ng proyekto na nagkaron ng pagkakataong magawa  ang mga pelikula na ito.', 'Mensahe ng Pelikula sa mga Pilipino', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '5-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-16 00:37:57', '2018-03-16 04:37:57', '', 5, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/2018/03/16/5-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

By bringing to the fore these realities in our consciousness, they all make a dramatic, hard-hitting, provocative and urgent call to ACTION.\r\n\r\nNow that their films have made us aware of the plight of these people, often living below the radar of our day-to-day routines, the filmmakers have given these people a voice, one that we cannot ignore in the face of our pressing everyday concerns.\r\n\r\nSome of these films are cited here, not for their outstanding qualities as motion pictures (although some of these are, certainly, excellent films) but for their content and subject matter which constitute the call for action and for change – in society, in governance, in our mindsets as a people who must be made aware that these conditions and realities exist – and that this knowledge should serve to move us to take action.\r\n\r\nPOVERTY and the ECONOMY force the characters in some Cinemalaya entries to go through harrowing actions, make tough decisions and is the reason why they find themselves embroiled in situations that are unforgettable for the viewers.\r\n\r\n“DONOR” was about a woman who is forced to donate a part of her body in order to make ends meet, while “PAMILYA ORDINARYO” gave viewers a closer look at what it’s like for a very young couple of street kids to have – and lose – their baby in the busy, cold and hard metropolis they themselves must navigate as hardened young survivors.\r\n\r\n“SAMPAGUITA” was also a window into the lives of the kids we see everyday darting in and out of busy streets to sell garlands for the motorists’ cars.\r\n\r\n“ENDO” was a rumination on how the work force of this country must bite the bullet and accept employment that gives them little in terms of security and a future that would sustain them as gainfully-employed individuals in the long term. Set against a love story framework, the film actually has as its core the current workers’ seemingly unending quest for permanence, stability and security – in life, as in love, not to keep flitting in and out of engagements that always come to a halt at the “end of contract.”\r\n\r\n“DONSOL” is A CALL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS and the PRESERVATION that also makes use of a potent romantic storyline and exquisite cinematography to highlight the magnificence and the threats to their existence faced by the whale sharks.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly MARGINALIZED YOUTH is likewise the subject of Cinemalaya entries like “TRIBU.” Focusing on the tough-talking and tough-living Tondo kids who find a sense of brotherhood in their gangs and whose outlet is fliptop rap and street showdowns, I recall director Jim Libiran pleading with the Tondo policemen to desist from picking and locking up the Tondo boys indiscriminately during his acceptance speech on awards night. He pointed out that some of these so-called “habitual offenders” were actually onstage that night, receiving acclaim for the film they starred in and starting to make a life of honor, recognition and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe youth of the country need saving, indeed, according to some Cinemalaya entries. And not only on the streets of Manila, but also in the countryside.\r\n\r\nThis was the focus of “ANG GURO KONG DI MARUNONG MAGBASA,” a violent treatise on how mere children are recruited into armies, taught to bear and use firearms, and to kill.\r\n\r\nAnd in “ASINTADO,” Nueva Ecija is the setting wherein a teenager botches a drug courier job he is forced to take on, mobilizing his mother and younger brother, a sharpshooting child suffering from autism, to go on a suspenseful mission to save him from the ringleaders.\r\n\r\n“TAKLUB” featured great actress Nora Aunor in the center of a piece tackling the effects of Typhoon Yolanda.\r\n\r\nTragedy and drama are not the only vehicles that Cinemalaya entries have employed through all its years of existence, comedy and satire have also effectively sounded their own call to action in the festival – most notably in “ANG BABAE SA SEPTIC TANK.”\r\n\r\nThis film employs everything including a movie-within-a-movie device to posit the superbly engaging and hard-hitting “poverty porn” theme that is said to fuel interest of foreign film festivals in some of our locally-produced films. The humor, in the end, is what makes this film even more effective in highlighting the NEED to improve the quality of life of people in our society.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few films that were part of Cinemalaya in various years – all depicting the realities that we must be made aware of, examine and strive to change… for the better.', 'Cinemalaya is a Wake-Up Call To All Filipinos: It’s Time To Change', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'cinemalaya-is-a-wake-up-call-to-all-filipinos-its-time-to-change', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:39:02', '2018-03-20 14:39:02', '', 0, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/?p=45', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The sad thing is after the operation has been conducted, they have sold what they think is a huge amount of money costing 100,000 pesos. They were caught off guard. After a year, the 100,000 pesos was already spent. They did not have anything to show. They think that their lives will be normal but it wouldn\'t for the reason that they are more prone to sickness like high blood pressure and they are more susceptible to diseases because they lost an organ in their system. At the same time, smoking and drinking is prohibited to people who have donated their kidneys because their resistance is weaker compared to when they still had both.

Kapag ako ay lumilikha ng pelikula ang nasasaloob sa mga ito ay ang pananaw ko sa mundo, sa ating bansa at ang mga kaisipan at damdamin na nais kong maipahayag, mailabas, at maibahigi sa mga manonood nito.\r\n\r\nAng una kong pelikula na naisali sa film festival ay ang “North Diversion Road” sa Cinema One Orignals dahil noong unang dalawang taon na magsimula ang Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival taong 2005 at 2006, empleyado ako ng Cultural Center of the Philippines — ang ibig sabihin nito ay hindi ako maaring sumali sa kanilang film festival. Noong ako ay natapos magtrabaho sa CCP, dumating ang pagkakataon ko na makapagpasa ng aking nagawang pelikula sa kanila. Ang unang ginawa ko para sa Cinemalaya ay ang pamagat nito ay “Tukso” — isa siyang thriller. Tungkol ito sa kwento ng isang babae na pinatay at ang hinahanap ay kung sino ang may kagagawan sa kanyang kamatayan. Ang pahayag ng mga hurado sa taon na sumali ako sa Cinemalaya ay nagustuhan nila sa “Tukso” ay kung paano pinakikita ang mga karakter ng mga tauhan sa paraan na inilalahad din yung kwento at ung onti-unti kang nadadala doon sa pelikula dahil ang kwento ay kung papaano malalaman sino ang may kagagawan sa pagkamatay ng isang karakter.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" />\r\n\r\nDalawang pelikula ang ipinasa ko sa Cinemalaya, ang isa ay tungkol sa isang kandidato sa eleksyon, ang pamagat nito ay “Vox Populi”, at isa naman yung sa “Tukso”. Ang “Vox Populi” ay hindi katwiran na nakapaloob sa social concern bagamat ang paraan ng pagpapakita at pinapapahayag ko sa loob ng kwento at sa pagagawa ng pelikula, pinalabas ko yung realidad ng mga tao sa kata na lugar na kinapapalooban ng kwento. Ang “Vox Populi” ay tungkol naman sa isang kandidato. Tatlong taon ang nakalipas, pagkaraan, muli kong sinulat. Ang pelikula na ito ay ang natanggap sa Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival 6. Ang “Vox Populi” ay maliwanag na nangangatwiran mayroon social concern dahil talagang batay ang kuwento sa totoong karakter ko bilang isang campaign aid sa kampanya sa politika. Ang nakapaloob sa “Vox Populi” ay ibintay sa totoong mga pangyayari. Nakakatawa dito, mayroong dating isang gobernador ng isang probinsya na nakapanood ng aking pelikula at kanyang pinahayag ay tunay at katotohanan ang mga nangyayari sa pelikula na \"Vox Populi\".\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture4-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"394\" />\r\n\r\nMaaga ako nagsimula na magtrabaho sa teatro at sa pelikula. Noong magsimula ako, hindi pa ako nakatapos sa pag-aaral. Labing-pitong gulang ako noong magtrabaho ako sa industriya ng mainstream na pelikula. Noong nagkaron na ng tinatawag nating \"Digital Revolution” naging mas madali gumawa ng pelikula. Naisipan kong magkaron ng pagkakataon na gumawa ng mga pelikula dahil mayroon akong nais ipahayag, meron akong mga nais na ibahagi sa mga tatangkilik na aking mga gawa. Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga festivals na kagaya ng “Cinema One Originals” at ng “Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival”, nakapagpasa ako ng proyekto na nagkaron ng pagkakataong magawa  ang mga pelikula na ito.', 'Mensahe ng Pelikula sa mga Pilipino', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '5-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-16 00:48:46', '2018-03-16 04:48:46', '', 5, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/2018/03/16/5-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(66, 1, '2018-03-16 01:07:57', '2018-03-16 05:07:57', 'In 2009, I had a meet-up in a coffee shop in San Juan with La Salle alumnus and writer-producer-actor-director Mike Sandejas. He was embarking on another Cinemalaya project, three years after winning the Balanghai trophy for his film about iconic rock band, The Dawn, in 2006 (“Tulad ng Dati”).\r\n\r\nHe was offering me the role of the suffering mom of the movie’s female lead, Nina, a troubled teen who was a rebel, a budding rock singer who would form a friendship with a good-looking deaf-mute dancer, much to the chagrin of her parents (especially her authoritarian dad). Zoe Sandejas, Mike’s beautiful and talented daughter, would be playing the lead. Her leading man would be a young actor (and true-to-life hearing-impaired artist from St. Benilde) Rome Mallari, whom I had the pleasure of knowing from his work in Gantimpala Theater Foundation (where I was playing lead for classics like “Florante at Laura” and “Kanser: Noli Me Tangere”).\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next few weeks, we would shoot in locations such as La Salle Greenhills and in Baguio.\r\n\r\nThe experience was pretty much like being on the set with college friends on a project that everyone was pulling for and believed in: we were made aware of Mike’s vision and were working in concert towards realizing that vision and committing it to film.\r\n\r\nEventually, we would be rewarded during the Cinemalaya awards night (the film took home the Audience’s Choice and National Council for Children’s Television Awards, plus the Balanghai Trophy for Best Musical Score), other awards from other bodies including recognition for Rome and for the Musical Score, and an extended run in several campuses and other venues.\r\n\r\nActing in this “Cinemalaya” film made me realize some things:\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n 	<li>A CINEMALAYA FILM is usually fueled by the very personal vision of the filmmaker. Since he himself was producing the movie, Mike had full creative control, without the dictates of a studio or a mainstream producer. The film he was creating, it turns out, also resonated with him on a deep, personal basis – touching on matters that were very real to him, his family and the relationships that governed this family.</li>\r\n 	<li>NOTHING IS AS PLEASURABLE AS WORKING WITH FAMILIAR PEOPLE, OR A COMPANY THAT WOULD BECOME FRIENDS. Mike had commissioned his long-time friends to be part of the cast, specifically the adult characters. It was good to be working again with old friends and co-workers such as singer and film, TV and theater actor Robert Sena, who was playing the sensitive psychologist whom Zoe’s parents would consult when she threatens to spin away from their reach, and Assistant Director, industry veteran Direk Armando Reyes, whom I had the pleasure of working with in some films of Adolfo Alix, Jr. Lorenzo (Tata) Mara, former model and erstwhile leading man of many films in the 80s and 90s, was playing the role of the Dad, a figure whose face is never seen, selected for his commanding voice, a presence who instills so much fear and resentment in his daughter. His wife, Angie, was a former fellow TV commercial model of mine, who now heads her own Talent Agency. He and I rode up to Baguio together and shared a late meal at Pizza Volante upon getting there before proceeding to our quarters. Up to now, he is a constant textmate, since Tata is fond of sharing inspirational quotes from the Bible. A sad note: on our way back to Manila, Tata got word that Star Cinema director Cathy Garcia-Molina, whom we left shooting in the Summer Capital, had just lost her husband in a biking accident on location.

His wife, Angie, was a former fellow TV commercial model of mine, who now heads her own Talent Agency. He and I rode up to Baguio together and shared a late meal at Pizza Volante upon getting there before proceeding to our quarters. Up to now, he is a constant textmate, since Tata is fond of sharing inspirational quotes from the Bible.

What I liked about it is the story played along the lines of “yes we are predictable” and “nope that’s not what I expected”. The story is about a boy who saw his twin die in front of his eyes. The boy comes back home from abroad to a dysfunctional family. The boy finds himself wanting to fix his family by talking/ consulting to his dead twin.  He highlights the silences that do exist in long drawn bouts with grief.\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-73\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"535\" />\r\n\r\nThe story shows the complexity of a family that goes through a circumstance and how they can get out of it - how they help themselves. Gibson (the main character in the story), is the main focus of the story.  Yes the film gave out romantic cliches and how a normal teenager should act but this is my personal ideal storyline for family concept. The story shows the characters going through emotional hardship, to a point where each of them gave up their dreams. One day, the dad of Gibson sneaks inside his room and find his computer open with thumbnails of videos. If I didn’t mention, Gibson walks around with a camera in the story - that’s why perception from viewers of the film is that it could be hipster. Anyway, to cut the chase the dad opens the videos and they were all moments of joy, joy that is something to cry a waterfall about - literally. The scene cuts to Gibson behind his camera taking those moments and he closes his eyes to feel it. This is for me the perfect rendition (OUT OF ANYTHING ELSE IN FAMILIAL MOVIES) of HURT in the family is - losing someone and could not get out the circumstance.  This boy keeps beautiful moments with him, hoping for change in his family. At the end, it did not have that big family hug playing “seasons of love in the background” NO!. RATHER, the ending is remarkable. The director ended it with just the mom and Gibson - no dad, and two sisters in the frame. They were all busy in outside watching the fireworks, and Gibson goes inside the room of his mom.

Family-oriented films become impactful (at least for me personally) if 1) there’s a twist 2)they don’t end up singing and hugging in front of a grand piano at the end 3) a dash of humor.

Personally, this film is the most remarkable LGBT related movie I’ve ever seen. And I wasn’t the only one with the same sentiments. Its influence was so widespread that they had to show and bring it to Manhattan for international screening. In a nutshell, it talks about how a young boy can live his life normally without the oftentimes heavy burden of hiding one’s sexuality. This story brings out a very powerful voice for the LGBT community wherein it showed the complexity of the elements involved in the concepts of “homosexuality” and “ innocence”. These complexities were highlighted in the simple story of a young boy exposed to corruption and despondency. Maxi showed truthfulness and heart all throughout the film. It speaks toward a reality we live in now, which wasn’t the case at the time. The reality being that one’s sexual orientation is not “just a phase” and doesn’t need to affect the way people around you interact with you. Maxi is not defined by his sexuality, but simply by his person and everyone around him treats him as exactly what he is - a good, and honest little boy. There are no formal rites of passage, no overly elaborate plot that pushes him to grow up and out of his puppy love feelings for the policeman he has a crush on. Audiences may misunderstand the title “The Blossoming”, however in the story Maxi\'s metamorphic blossoming results from what essentially is an innocent crush that curiously develops into an ambiguous attraction. This being from the very first Cinemalaya film festival, was a brave move considering the social climate of the Philippines toward LGBT culture at the time. For many years, being “bakla” or “tomboy” in Philippine media would always have a comedic connotation - the overly rambunctious cross-dressing gay and the virgin tomboy awaiting a real man’s touch. And for many years, this form of “toleration” of the LGBT community was all the representation there was in Philippine society. But through films like this, the truth of the LGBT community’s story is brought out of the shadows and onto the silver screen for all to open their eyes. It is thanks to this movie that many more entries into the Cinemalaya film festival were able to be transparent about sexuality - a most taboo discussion for a traditionally Catholic country. Especially through the perspective of an innocent child just going through life, experiencing every “normal” encounter in a young person’s life - like a simple crush. This simply told story about a little crush will always represent the truth of humanity - no matter who we are and where we come from we all deserve to love.', 'How Brave, Maxi', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-brave-maxi', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:42:01', '2018-03-20 14:42:01', '', 0, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/?p=132', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Kapag ako ay lumilikha ng pelikula ang nasasaloob sa mga ito ay ang pananaw ko sa mundo, sa ating bansa at ang mga kaisipan at damdamin na nais kong maipahayag, mailabas, at maibahigi sa mga manonood nito.\r\n\r\nAng una kong pelikula na naisali sa film festival ay ang “North Diversion Road” sa Cinema One Orignals dahil noong unang dalawang taon na magsimula ang Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival taong 2005 at 2006, empleyado ako ng Cultural Center of the Philippines — ang ibig sabihin nito ay hindi ako maaring sumali sa kanilang film festival. Noong ako ay natapos magtrabaho sa CCP, dumating ang pagkakataon ko na makapagpasa ng aking nagawang pelikula sa kanila. Ang unang ginawa ko para sa Cinemalaya ay ang pamagat nito ay “Tukso” — isa siyang thriller. Tungkol ito sa kwento ng isang babae na pinatay at ang hinahanap ay kung sino ang may kagagawan sa kanyang kamatayan. Ang pahayag ng mga hurado sa taon na sumali ako sa Cinemalaya ay nagustuhan nila sa “Tukso” ay kung paano pinakikita ang mga karakter ng mga tauhan sa paraan na inilalahad din yung kwento at ung onti-unti kang nadadala doon sa pelikula dahil ang kwento ay kung papaano malalaman sino ang may kagagawan sa pagkamatay ng isang karakter.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" />\r\n\r\nDalawang pelikula ang ipinasa ko sa Cinemalaya, ang isa ay tungkol sa isang kandidato sa eleksyon, ang pamagat nito ay “Vox Populi”, at isa naman yung sa “Tukso”. Ang “Vox Populi” ay hindi katwiran na nakapaloob sa social concern bagamat ang paraan ng pagpapakita at pinapapahayag ko sa loob ng kwento at sa pagagawa ng pelikula, pinalabas ko yung realidad ng mga tao sa kata na lugar na kinapapalooban ng kwento. Ang “Vox Populi” ay tungkol naman sa isang kandidato. Tatlong taon ang nakalipas, pagkaraan, muli kong sinulat. Ang pelikula na ito ay ang natanggap sa Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival 6. Ang “Vox Populi” ay maliwanag na nangangatwiran mayroon social concern dahil talagang batay ang kuwento sa totoong karakter ko bilang isang campaign aid sa kampanya sa politika. Ang nakapaloob sa “Vox Populi” ay ibintay sa totoong mga pangyayari. Nakakatawa dito, mayroong dating isang gobernador ng isang probinsya na nakapanood ng aking pelikula at kanyang pinahayag ay tunay at katotohanan ang mga nangyayari sa pelikula na \"Vox Populi\".\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture4-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"394\" />\r\n\r\nMaaga ako nagsimula na magtrabaho sa teatro at sa pelikula.

Noong nagkaron na ng tinatawag nating \"Digital Revolution” naging mas madali gumawa ng pelikula. Naisipan kong magkaron ng pagkakataon na gumawa ng mga pelikula dahil mayroon akong nais ipahayag, meron akong mga nais na ibahagi sa mga tatangkilik na aking mga gawa.

Sa Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival nagkaron ng pagkakataon ang mga maraming director na maglahad at magpahayag ng kanilang mga kuwento. Kapag hihintayin natin ang mainstream, matagal pa ito mangyayari. Bukod pa, ang mga pelikula na ipinalabas sa Cinemalaya, at dahil sa kalidad ng mga pelikulang pinalabas sa film festival na ito, marami sa mga festival programmers sa buong mundo ang hinihintay ang mga pelikulang ilalabas sa Cinemalaya.\r\n\r\nHindi pa natatapos film festival, iniimbita na ng mga festival programmers mula sa ibang bansa ang mga pelikula na ipinapalabas sa Cinemalaya para isali sa kanilang sariling paligsahan. Ito ay mga international na film festival, katulad ng Berlin International Film Festival, Venice International Film Festival, Tokyo International Film Festival, Busan International Film Festival, at iba pa. Sa mga filmmakers na nakakaalam kung paano umaandar ang  mga festivals, isang itong malaki at mahalaga na bagay. Unang una, ang mga film festivals, mga programmers, at mga festival directors, patuloy na naghahanap ng magaganda at makabubuluhang mga pelikula. Nagpapasa rin ang  iba marami upang mapili, ngunit ang mga festival programmers ang nag dumadayo sa ating bansa upang sila ay makapili ng mga pelikulang maisasali nila sa kanilang film festival.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/insert3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"418\" />\r\n\r\nHindi pa nagwawakas ang Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival, may imbitasyon na makasali sa mga intenational film festivals ang ibang mga pelikula, halimbawa, sa nakaraang Cinemalaya 13, ang “Baconaua” na inilikha ni Director Joseph Israel Laban ay nananalo ng Special Jury Award at Best Cinematography ay naimbitahan agad ito sa Busan International Film Festival. Malaking bagay na nakakaharap ng filmmakers ang mga festival programmers dahil nagkakaron ng pagkakataon ang mga pelikula na gawa ng mga Pilipino na mapanood ng mga ibang mamamayan na hindi taga rito sa ating bansa. Nagkakaroon sila ng  mga bagong pananaw tungkol sa pagkatao ng mga Pilipino sa mga pamamagitan ng mga pelikula na pinalalabas, kagaya na rin ang magandang nangyayari dito sa atin. Marami sanang manonood ng mga pelikulang galing sa Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival o mga iba pang film festivals na mayroon tayo sa bansa dahil ang mga kuwentong kanilang ipinakikita ay hindi mga karaniwang kuwento na napapanood natin ng katulad sa industriya ng mainstream cinema bagamat hindi lahat, pero malimit na kapag mainstream,  ang nakikita natin ay love story, o kaya\'y kwento ng isang karakter na inabuso at naghirap; pagkatapos ay magtatagumpay sa huli — malimit ito ang kwento ng mga pelikula na nasasaloob sa mainstream cinema. Ngunit para sa akin, hindi lang sa mga aspetong ibinabahagi ng mainstream ang kuwento ng karaniwang Pilipino. Sa mga pinapalabas ng Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival, nakikita natin ang mga kwento ng hindi lang ng mga taga-Maynila kundi ng iba pang mga kababayan natin na nagmumula sa ibang panig ng Pilipinas, at mga buhay ng ibang mga tao na kung minsan ay hindi magihawa.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"461\" />\r\n\r\nSa mga sumusuporta sa Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival, sana ay ipagpatuloy ninyo ang pagtangkilik sa pelikulang ito.

Cinemalaya films can illuminate person’s real situation through different shot angles, silent scenes and the most absurd ways to make a rendition of a situation. Say for example a scene from “Pamilyang Ordinaryo” back in 2016.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture8-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"451\" />\r\n\r\nThe story ends with an internal shot of “Arjan” and “Jane” inside the bus after finding out that after all the hardships they have put through finding their baby, at the end they got the wrong baby. The shot did not have any dialogue rather just ambient sounds from the traffic. You see in a normal viewer’s perspective could be an opening ending and for them “what’s next for the couple?” Presumptions like that could be considered but then again in an artist’s perspective it could mean more than just a disappointment.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-37\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />\r\n\r\nAs an amateur filmmaker, in the industry we consider the use of sound, space, how it was shot, characters etc. at that scene, the silence coming from the couple, the boxed space inside the bus and the shakiness coming from the bus’ movement meant more like “I give up”.  I really like this scene because personally it seems a bit cheesy to watch it and some would be annoyed but it is a scene that inspired me and say “explore more!” And these types of scenes is what I carry with as an amateur artist. These scenes that are real, relatable even by using silence can explain it all. I’ve always been taught to “never underestimate your audience”, know who you want to target in the story, as much as possible target them all. Going back to my quote for the “normal viewers”, always remember that your viewers may have different versions of “touched” just like a filmmaker making abstract scenes that in the end becomes so relatable it hits you. “Touched” for your audience could mean crying, mad, disappointment, annoyed, inspired, pity, guilt and a whole list from the emotion book. Filipinos are known for their “altruistic” characteristic we all like crying together and we feel like we are in same situations however Cinemalaya offers more than that. It offers different perspectives, allows space for multiple renditions and it is up to you and only you however you understood it and when you start thinking of all of those imaginations of scenes in your head thay when you know you’ve been “TOUCHED”. Writing a story, producing it and having a film on the big screen could be a truly inspiring moment, the same point as I have said earlier, it could be something to cry about, laugh about but at the end of your day as a filmmaker its your audience’s eyes that would tell if your story is inspiring.', 'Inspired To Create Films That Touch Lives', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '33-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:37:57', '2018-03-20 14:37:57', '', 33, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/article/33-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It is always a commentary on how ludicrous or how weird everything is starting to become. What used to be uncanny and unacceptable, at least 10 or 20 years ago, is the “new normal”. In my film Donor (2010), the act of selling one’s organ for 100,000 pesos that is a part of you, your identity, and who you are is just \"normal”.  I always begin the concepts of my film by looking and exploring around unusual jobs. It actually started when I read about a job called “organ transporter”, which is actually a legal job. This is a job that is being practiced in the United States and Mexico.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-42\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture11-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"559\" />\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of this person is to transport organs for emergency and operations. Do you imagine the moral issues that you deal with moving organs? When I started writing the script and doing research, I have studied that the Philippines is the third country in the whole world with the biggest issue of \"organ trafficking” — First is China, second is India, and third comes the Philippines. I thought it was shocking that many people in the Philippines are selling their organs for a price. When i started telling and sharing to people what about my research and idea for the film, I spoke to Joel Lamangan and he said “Go to Baseco. There are a lot of people there who have sold their organs” and I asked him “Paano ko malalaman? You don’t just go there.” and Joel replied “No, no. just go there”, and so I did. I went to Baseco and looked for the barangay captain. True enough I told the barangay captain that i needed to interview someone who has sold their kidney for a fee and he told me, “Madali lang yan. Halika, sumama ka sa akin” . We went to the Gawad Kalinga village in Baseco, he knocked on the first door and surprisingly the person who happened to live there already sold his kidney. Imagine how many people who reside in Baseco has sold their kidneys for a price. Apparently 90% of the pedicab drivers in Baseco have sold a kidney 7 or 8 years ago.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-43\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture12-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"559\" />\r\n\r\nEach one of them has different prices and varying stories. The sad thing is after the operation has been conducted, they have sold what they think is a huge amount of money costing 100,000 pesos. They were caught off guard. After a year, the 100,000 pesos was already spent. They did not have anything to show. They think that their lives will be normal but it wouldn\'t for the reason that they are more prone to sickness like high blood pressure and they are more susceptible to diseases because they lost an organ in their system. At the same time, smoking and drinking is prohibited to people who have donated their kidneys because their resistance is weaker compared to when they still had both.

(153, 1, '2018-03-20 10:39:02', '2018-03-20 14:39:02', 'Intrinsic in the Festival title is the implication that “CINEMA IS A CATALYST FOR FREEDOM,” or that “THESE MOVIES ARE THE PRODUCT OF MINDS AND CREATIVE FORCES THAT ARE FREE TO EXPLORE, TO PRESENT REALITIES AND VARIOUS FACETS OF IT, TO CALL PEOPLE AND SOCIETY TO CHANGE.”\r\n\r\nDevoid of the usual hindrances of regulation and censorship, the festival guidelines give the filmmakers and artists creative freedom to flesh out and present their entries.\r\n\r\nIn the entries that have comprised the festivals from 2005 to 2017, many of the themes were, indeed, crafted to serve as eye-openers to various aspects of our realities in these present times.\r\n\r\nAnd most of these films did not stop at being agents of enlightenment. By bringing to the fore these realities in our consciousness, they all make a dramatic, hard-hitting, provocative and urgent call to ACTION.\r\n\r\nNow that their films have made us aware of the plight of these people, often living below the radar of our day-to-day routines, the filmmakers have given these people a voice, one that we cannot ignore in the face of our pressing everyday concerns.\r\n\r\nSome of these films are cited here, not for their outstanding qualities as motion pictures (although some of these are, certainly, excellent films) but for their content and subject matter which constitute the call for action and for change – in society, in governance, in our mindsets as a people who must be made aware that these conditions and realities exist – and that this knowledge should serve to move us to take action.\r\n\r\nPOVERTY and the ECONOMY force the characters in some Cinemalaya entries to go through harrowing actions, make tough decisions and is the reason why they find themselves embroiled in situations that are unforgettable for the viewers.\r\n\r\n“DONOR” was about a woman who is forced to donate a part of her body in order to make ends meet, while “PAMILYA ORDINARYO” gave viewers a closer look at what it’s like for a very young couple of street kids to have – and lose – their baby in the busy, cold and hard metropolis they themselves must navigate as hardened young survivors.\r\n\r\n“SAMPAGUITA” was also a window into the lives of the kids we see everyday darting in and out of busy streets to sell garlands for the motorists’ cars.\r\n\r\n“ENDO” was a rumination on how the work force of this country must bite the bullet and accept employment that gives them little in terms of security and a future that would sustain them as gainfully-employed individuals in the long term. Set against a love story framework, the film actually has as its core the current workers’ seemingly unending quest for permanence, stability and security – in life, as in love, not to keep flitting in and out of engagements that always come to a halt at the “end of contract.”\r\n\r\n“DONSOL” is A CALL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS and the PRESERVATION that also makes use of a potent romantic storyline and exquisite cinematography to highlight the magnificence and the threats to their existence faced by the whale sharks.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly MARGINALIZED YOUTH is likewise the subject of Cinemalaya entries like “TRIBU.” Focusing on the tough-talking and tough-living Tondo kids who find a sense of brotherhood in their gangs and whose outlet is fliptop rap and street showdowns, I recall director Jim Libiran pleading with the Tondo policemen to desist from picking and locking up the Tondo boys indiscriminately during his acceptance speech on awards night. He pointed out that some of these so-called “habitual offenders” were actually onstage that night, receiving acclaim for the film they starred in and starting to make a life of honor, recognition and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe youth of the country need saving, indeed, according to some Cinemalaya entries. And not only on the streets of Manila, but also in the countryside.\r\n\r\nThis was the focus of “ANG GURO KONG DI MARUNONG MAGBASA,” a violent treatise on how mere children are recruited into armies, taught to bear and use firearms, and to kill.\r\n\r\nAnd in “ASINTADO,” Nueva Ecija is the setting wherein a teenager botches a drug courier job he is forced to take on, mobilizing his mother and younger brother, a sharpshooting child suffering from autism, to go on a suspenseful mission to save him from the ringleaders.\r\n\r\n“TAKLUB” featured great actress Nora Aunor in the center of a piece tackling the effects of Typhoon Yolanda.\r\n\r\nTragedy and drama are not the only vehicles that Cinemalaya entries have employed through all its years of existence, comedy and satire have also effectively sounded their own call to action in the festival – most notably in “ANG BABAE SA SEPTIC TANK.”\r\n\r\nThis film employs everything including a movie-within-a-movie device to posit the superbly engaging and hard-hitting “poverty porn” theme that is said to fuel interest of foreign film festivals in some of our locally-produced films. The humor, in the end, is what makes this film even more effective in highlighting the NEED to improve the quality of life of people in our society.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few films that were part of Cinemalaya in various years – all depicting the realities that we must be made aware of, examine and strive to change… for the better.', 'Cinemalaya is a Wake-Up Call To All Filipinos: It’s Time To Change', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '45-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:39:02', '2018-03-20 14:39:02', '', 45, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/article/45-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

From what I understand, Flip top is when Filipino rappers exchange rhyming insults to one another. It is a competition between who is wittier and more eloquent. A year ago, I have come across watching a Cinemala film entitled Respeto. Directed by Treb Monteras II, he was able to give the audiences a story much more than just about rap battles. It\'s about a boy named Hendrix who was born and raised in the slums. He did not have his parents but only lived with his drug addict big sister, and her drug dealer boyfriend who has sex almost the whole time they were being shown in the scenes. Eventually, Hendrix realizes that life is not at all fun and games when he comes across a retired poet, he will be the reason behind great life lessons that will be enough for Hendrix to change his ways and become a better person. There are reasons why I believe that this film became a huge impact in my life and these are just a few:\r\n\r\n<strong><b>Exceptionally good raps.</b></strong>\r\n\r\nThe lyrics of what was featured in the film have really given me such an amusement and respect to rappers. Being a 20 year old lady who have only fancied western rappers, It was a huge surprise for me to understand and fully digest the lyrics of each verses. It was though as if they were reciting their raps in a very casual and impromptu matter (although I know that it was written and was prepared even before they have started shooting the movie).\r\n\r\n<strong><b>Realistic Mise en Scene </b></strong>\r\n\r\nMr. Monteras was able to capture the disturbing environment of the slums that we have no intention of appreciating in mainstream films, but at the same time, he was able to artistically move around and play with the angles of which the milieu is interesting enough to captivate. The film also presented the ways of the war on drugs, which was very timely and relevant in the country. Soon enough, the little scenes such as rading the accused drug dealers and users and demolish their houses afterwards were a part of the film. This was something i would never forget because Hendrix\'s brother-in-law suddenly forces him to pee in a plastic because the police were about to rade them. Next thing he knows, his sister and his brother in law panics and he accidentally touches the poop in the plastic he was holding- Yuck!\r\n\r\n<strong><b>Revolves around the rap culture.</b></strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, the life inside and outside of rapping was the focus on most of the scenes the film. It gave me an impression that Flip Top is no game and a hobby of wanna-be hip-hop Filipino groups is an art form that entails practice, word power, and excellence. The approach of adding a veteran poet in the character made the film much more interesting because I was able to compare and contrast rapping in the modern era and the classics of <em><i>pakikipagbalagtasan </i></em>in other words poetic competition.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few things that I have noticed in the film and are the causes of which I never thought would make me view Flip Top in a different way.

Think of it this way: Two kids living in the streets of Manila have themselves a new-born baby, gets stolen by a seemingly generous male cross dresser and searches for their missing child. Through the journey, they experience disgusting maltreatment from the police (who should be the first ones to help them), criminal acts, a news feature, and false hopes.\r\n\r\nFor those individuals who are afraid to experience first hand or even witness minors doing drugs, stealing, robbing, and cursing as their language in locations such as marketplaces, street corners, tunnels and bridges- this is not at all an imagination and is a nightmare to passersby.\r\n\r\nWhat is oddly interesting is that, while this is the continuous issue running in the country, it is still unrecognized and shrugged off by the people of who can help prevent these unfortunate events. The film added the CCTV footages as a tool to depict the reality of which we ourselves may be unaware of and is already happening. The power of the film being able to shamelessly let its audience feel disturbed is very effective.\r\n\r\nThe starring couple, Jane and Aries is presented as a very mischievous duo. To survive a day they have no choice but to do reckless activities such as pickpocketing, having sex, screaming, sleeping, fighting but despite of it all, they are each other\'s strong foundation and manage to deal with each other as family. The scenes in the film produced a number of metaphors that is timely to the social and economic situation of the Philippines under the brackets C and D.\r\n\r\nThroughout the long feature- and aside from the vulgar scenes about hypocrisy, unjust and abusive social and governmental institutions that supposedly help and protect the poor and the oppressed, the couple have been the main focus of the evidences of these truths because as hard and difficult as it is to digest the story, it is always a taboo that we wish we could change.\r\n\r\nFor someone who has only started watching Cinemalaya films for only 3 years and counting, this is the only film that has been very moving and has achieved to raise- consciousness to the Filipino audience. The vulgar representation of what the title means by Pamilya Ordinaryo depicts an ironic theme due to the several consecutive unfortunate events that had happened to the starring couple. The disheartening realization after viewing the film is how society do not give so much importance to the point wherein it has become the biggest taboo in the country, which makes it a spectacular- touching film.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind a great admiration for the film is that it showed a very authentic and raw situation of the life of poor teenage parents who were victimized by their family, agents of the police, media, local government, heartless pranksters.

He was embarking on another Cinemalaya project, three years after winning the Balanghai trophy for his film about iconic rock band, The Dawn, in 2006 (“Tulad ng Dati”).\r\n\r\nHe was offering me the role of the suffering mom of the movie’s female lead, Nina, a troubled teen who was a rebel, a budding rock singer who would form a friendship with a good-looking deaf-mute dancer, much to the chagrin of her parents (especially her authoritarian dad). Zoe Sandejas, Mike’s beautiful and talented daughter, would be playing the lead. Her leading man would be a young actor (and true-to-life hearing-impaired artist from St. Benilde) Rome Mallari, whom I had the pleasure of knowing from his work in Gantimpala Theater Foundation (where I was playing lead for classics like “Florante at Laura” and “Kanser: Noli Me Tangere”).\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next few weeks, we would shoot in locations such as La Salle Greenhills and in Baguio.\r\n\r\nThe experience was pretty much like being on the set with college friends on a project that everyone was pulling for and believed in: we were made aware of Mike’s vision and were working in concert towards realizing that vision and committing it to film.\r\n\r\nEventually, we would be rewarded during the Cinemalaya awards night (the film took home the Audience’s Choice and National Council for Children’s Television Awards, plus the Balanghai Trophy for Best Musical Score), other awards from other bodies including recognition for Rome and for the Musical Score, and an extended run in several campuses and other venues.\r\n\r\nActing in this “Cinemalaya” film made me realize some things:\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n 	<li>A CINEMALAYA FILM is usually fueled by the very personal vision of the filmmaker. Since he himself was producing the movie, Mike had full creative control, without the dictates of a studio or a mainstream producer. The film he was creating, it turns out, also resonated with him on a deep, personal basis – touching on matters that were very real to him, his family and the relationships that governed this family.</li>\r\n 	<li>NOTHING IS AS PLEASURABLE AS WORKING WITH FAMILIAR PEOPLE, OR A COMPANY THAT WOULD BECOME FRIENDS. Mike had commissioned his long-time friends to be part of the cast, specifically the adult characters. It was good to be working again with old friends and co-workers such as singer and film, TV and theater actor Robert Sena, who was playing the sensitive psychologist whom Zoe’s parents would consult when she threatens to spin away from their reach, and Assistant Director, industry veteran Direk Armando Reyes, whom I had the pleasure of working with in some films of Adolfo Alix, Jr. Lorenzo (Tata) Mara, former model and erstwhile leading man of many films in the 80s and 90s, was playing the role of the Dad, a figure whose face is never seen, selected for his commanding voice, a presence who instills so much fear and resentment in his daughter. His wife, Angie, was a former fellow TV commercial model of mine, who now heads her own Talent Agency. He and I rode up to Baguio together and shared a late meal at Pizza Volante upon getting there before proceeding to our quarters. Up to now, he is a constant textmate, since Tata is fond of sharing inspirational quotes from the Bible. A sad note: on our way back to Manila, Tata got word that Star Cinema director Cathy Garcia-Molina, whom we left shooting in the Summer Capital, had just lost her husband in a biking accident on location. From time to time I see Zoe in my FB feeds and in her various gigs as model and performer.</li>\r\n 	<li>AS EXPECTED, THE PACE IS NOT AS PUNISHING AS IN MAINSTREAM TV OR FILM. Although definitely working on a budget, we were not rushing to catch an episode for airing that same day, nor were we being monitored by the Producer and being hurried to finish immediately (the Producer was right there, behind the camera).</li>\r\n 	<li>YOUTH-ORIENTED FILMS HAVE A STRONG AND CONSIDERABLE MARKET IN CINEMALAYA. Students all over the country have become true fans of the two leads and the film. Fortunately, the leads deliver engaging and heartfelt performances, have strong chemistry together and are both easy on the eyes. And the film turned out to be a real delight: by turns humorous, dramatic, romantic and simply charming. Which brings me to:</li>\r\n 	<li>A CROWD-PLEASING CINEMALAYA FILM IS A JOY TO BE PART OF.

For us Filipinos, family is where we’ll always have a soft spot for and from 2008, the storylines has always been limited - rather reserved. Cinemalaya through the years have escalated to be the landscape of family, politics, sex, drugs, religion and I would say filmmakers started playing around the storylines of these issues in 2012, at least for me when I started seeing the “abstract”. I came across this indie film called “Ang Nawawala” by Marie Jamora and if anyone would have take a look on their poster it would look like a movie for hipsters. Is it about family?<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-72\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" />\r\n\r\nYes. Is there drama? Yes. Romance? Yes. Everyone looks for “not so brilliant but maybe new” “yung bago naman, puro ganun naman storya eh boy meets girl ends up or doesn’t end up together one dies or one has cancer and survives then becomes a family person”  YES THIS IS EXACTLY THE FRONT OF “Ang Nawawala”. What I liked about it is the story played along the lines of “yes we are predictable” and “nope that’s not what I expected”. The story is about a boy who saw his twin die in front of his eyes. The boy comes back home from abroad to a dysfunctional family. The boy finds himself wanting to fix his family by talking/ consulting to his dead twin.  He highlights the silences that do exist in long drawn bouts with grief.\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-73\" src=\"http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Picture22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"535\" />\r\n\r\nThe story shows the complexity of a family that goes through a circumstance and how they can get out of it - how they help themselves. Gibson (the main character in the story), is the main focus of the story.  Yes the film gave out romantic cliches and how a normal teenager should act but this is my personal ideal storyline for family concept. The story shows the characters going through emotional hardship, to a point where each of them gave up their dreams. One day, the dad of Gibson sneaks inside his room and find his computer open with thumbnails of videos. If I didn’t mention, Gibson walks around with a camera in the story - that’s why perception from viewers of the film is that it could be hipster. Anyway, to cut the chase the dad opens the videos and they were all moments of joy, joy that is something to cry a waterfall about - literally. The scene cuts to Gibson behind his camera taking those moments and he closes his eyes to feel it. This is for me the perfect rendition (OUT OF ANYTHING ELSE IN FAMILIAL MOVIES) of HURT in the family is - losing someone and could not get out the circumstance.  This boy keeps beautiful moments with him, hoping for change in his family. At the end, it did not have that big family hug playing “seasons of love in the background” NO!. RATHER, the ending is remarkable. The director ended it with just the mom and Gibson - no dad, and two sisters in the frame. They were all busy in outside watching the fireworks, and Gibson goes inside the room of his mom. While his mom is sleeping he picks her up on his lap, watching TV of New year coverage on the screen. Gibson closes his eyes, without his camera and speaks.\r\n\r\nFamily-oriented films are notorious for “not bagging the award” because obviously in watching a slice of life kind of films production does not concentrate on visuals, editing and other technical stuff unless it is like the concept of “Ang Nawawala”. The impact of these films for a viewer’s standpoint is something they would rather brew at the back of their heads after watching, or something they just forget. Family-oriented films become impactful (at least for me personally) if 1) there’s a twist 2)they don’t end up singing and hugging in front of a grand piano at the end 3) a dash of humor. Filipinos are known for being very festive, creative and looking for a film that fits them (not only referring to family oriented movies but the diversity of movie genres as well) however, at ending credits of every film that we watch, no matter how much twist and turns (abstract, creativity, complexity of production) , upside downs,  family is a place that is our home for Filipinos and it is a concept we all yearn to see.', 'Cinemalaya Feels Like Home', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '70-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:41:07', '2018-03-20 14:41:07', '', 70, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/article/70-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

As someone who is not a fan of supporting mainstream Filipino movies, the expectations I have for Cinemalaya is quite high. Knowing that filmmakers are free to submit what they have to offer, I\'m very much pleased with seeing the LGBT community be a part of the characters. One of the films I have watched from Cinemalaya is entitled <em><i>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros, </i></em>which was directed by Auraeus Solito. The movie starred a 12-year-old boy named Maxi. Coming from the title, it is about the coming of age of a homosexual boy. The story revolved around how Maxi\'s family, his social status and his attitude towards whatever situation he is faced. There are a lot of films that were shown in Cinemalaya that are about Homosexuality. In fact, they populate almost all of the influential personalities in the country. These are Vice Ganda, BJ Pascual, Congresswoman Geraldine Roman and Rajo Laurel. As you might not have noticed, the ones that are mentioned are only those who are gay and transgender women. The representation and the acceptance of lesbians in country are not very popular. There are actually a lot of misconceptions about the lesbian community. One of its stereotypes is that a lesbian automatically wants to look like a boy, act like a boy and talk like a boy. Yes, the LGBT community is accepted in the country thus films like Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros but it\'s quite unfortunate that there aren\'t a lot of lesbian characters in Cinemalaya not as quite often as gay characters.

It is honest in the sense that filmmakers do not produce Cinemalaya films in order to make so much money. All of the stories that were created are from the heart. Every filmmaker, whether they win or not, they fabricated a movie that is sincere and not just to win. I am glad because I have seen Cinemalaya from the very beginning. It started from a small-scale until it reached this year. Usually Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival is held during the month of August when the rain pours which results to the people not being able to support the screenings of the films nevertheless through the years.. 13 great years, Cinemalaya has become a major force. The fact that some independent filmmakers measure their success when they are already producing mainstream movies nonetheless maybe it’s really how careers go or history folds. There is nothing wrong with mainstream cinema but I hope that the filmmakers who have entered the industry could always go back to making independent films. The end goal is not producing a low budget film to receive an award, or for you to be well known nor to make so much money. I don’t think that should be the final purpose of any filmmaker. I’m glad that Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival has given their audience a choice wherein people can watch their films that were produced without pressure for commercial viability.

(161, 1, '2018-03-20 10:42:01', '2018-03-20 14:42:01', 'A Classic cinemalaya film from back in 2005, Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros is a beautiful film by Auraeous Solito. A 12 year old Maximo Oliveros is from the slums in Manila. Maximo, lovingly referred to by his neighbors as Maxi, is gay. Despite his traditionally unaccepted sexual orientation, he is tenderly taken care of by his doting father and two older brothers. Maxi\'s family is engaged in a life of crime and monkey business ranging from peddling illegal drugs to pick-pocketing cellular phones. Personally, this film is the most remarkable LGBT related movie I’ve ever seen. And I wasn’t the only one with the same sentiments. Its influence was so widespread that they had to show and bring it to Manhattan for international screening. In a nutshell, it talks about how a young boy can live his life normally without the oftentimes heavy burden of hiding one’s sexuality. This story brings out a very powerful voice for the LGBT community wherein it showed the complexity of the elements involved in the concepts of “homosexuality” and “ innocence”. These complexities were highlighted in the simple story of a young boy exposed to corruption and despondency. Maxi showed truthfulness and heart all throughout the film. It speaks toward a reality we live in now, which wasn’t the case at the time. The reality being that one’s sexual orientation is not “just a phase” and doesn’t need to affect the way people around you interact with you. Maxi is not defined by his sexuality, but simply by his person and everyone around him treats him as exactly what he is - a good, and honest little boy. There are no formal rites of passage, no overly elaborate plot that pushes him to grow up and out of his puppy love feelings for the policeman he has a crush on. Audiences may misunderstand the title “The Blossoming”, however in the story Maxi\'s metamorphic blossoming results from what essentially is an innocent crush that curiously develops into an ambiguous attraction. This being from the very first Cinemalaya film festival, was a brave move considering the social climate of the Philippines toward LGBT culture at the time. For many years, being “bakla” or “tomboy” in Philippine media would always have a comedic connotation - the overly rambunctious cross-dressing gay and the virgin tomboy awaiting a real man’s touch. And for many years, this form of “toleration” of the LGBT community was all the representation there was in Philippine society. But through films like this, the truth of the LGBT community’s story is brought out of the shadows and onto the silver screen for all to open their eyes. It is thanks to this movie that many more entries into the Cinemalaya film festival were able to be transparent about sexuality - a most taboo discussion for a traditionally Catholic country. Especially through the perspective of an innocent child just going through life, experiencing every “normal” encounter in a young person’s life - like a simple crush. This simply told story about a little crush will always represent the truth of humanity - no matter who we are and where we come from we all deserve to love.', 'How Brave, Maxi', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '132-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-03-20 10:42:01', '2018-03-20 14:42:01', '', 132, 'http://throughtheeyes.info/iteration1/article/132-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

There are pros and cons in so many aspects of this norm and yet it is obvious that these affect how the society views the people who show their indifference from what is suppose to be accepted. \r\n\r\nWhen we talk about the specifics, majority of the Filipinos acknowledge the existence of the LGBT community however their actions and behavior do not reciprocate this. It may seem as if it is accepted just because many of the LGBT community already dominate certain fields but the discrimination and disgust is still present. As someone who sees the world in a totally different angle, which is at the losing end of the indiscretion happening in the society, it is unavoidable to feel outcasted and burdened. Furthermore, it hinders the LGBT group to be harmonious with the rest of the community. \r\n	\r\nThere are a number of people from the LGBT community who try to jar away from feeling secluded; they use many channels such as media to change the system. These brave souls use their intellect and capabilities for the society to be proven wrong.
